X(20948) is the trilinear pole of line X(1109)X(21207), which is the tangent to the inellipse that is the trilinear square of the de Longchamps line, at X(1109) (the trilinear square of X(523)).  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

<p>
X(20948): Let P1 and P2 be the two points on the de Longchamps line whose trilinear polars are parallel to the de Longchamps line.  P1 and P2 lie on the Kiepert hyperbola and circle {{X(2), X(98), X(99)}}.  X(20948) is the trilinear product P1*P2.  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)
