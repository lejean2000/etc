X(360) = A*[A] + B*[B] + C*[C], where A, B, C are the angles and [A], [B], [C] are the vertices

<p>
This point is obtained as a limit of perspectors. Let r denote a real number, but not 0 or 1. Using vertex B as a pivot, swing line BC toward vertex A through angle rB and swing line BC about C through angle rC. Let A(r) be the point in which the two swung lines meet.  Obtain B(r) and C(r) cyclically. Triangle A(r)B(r)C(r) is the <i>r-Hofstadter triangle</i>; its perspector with ABC, called the Hofstadter r point, is the point given by trilinears
</p>
<p>
(sin rA)/sin(A - rA) : (sin rB)/sin(B - rB) : (sin rC)/sin(C - rC).
</p>
<p>
The limit of this point as r approaches 0 is X(360). The two Hofstadter points, X(359) and X(360) are examples of transcendental triangle centers, since they have no trilinear or barycentric representation using only algebraic functions of a,b,c (or sin A, sin B, sin C).

<b>Conjecture and corollary (Randy Hutson, August 10, 2014): </b><br>
<i>If r is an integer other than 0, 1, or 2, then the inverse-in-circumcircle of the Hofstadter r point is the Hofstadter (2-r) point;<br>
thus, since the isogonal conjugate of the Hofstadter r point is the Hofstadter (1-r) point, if r is not -1, 0 or 1,<br>then the antigonal image of the Hofstadter r point is the Hofstadter -r point.</i>
