As a point on the Euler line, X(4) has Shinagawa coefficients (0, 1).

The tangents at A,B,C to the McCay cubic K003 concur in X(4).  Also, the tangents at A,B,C to the Lucas cubic K007 concur in X(4). (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let P be a point in the plane of ABC.  Let Oa be the circumcenter of BCP, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  Let Q be the circumcenter of OaObOc.  P = Q only when P = X(4). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p>
<p>
Taking a reference triangle ABC and a variable point P on the plane, P=X(3) is the point of maximal area of its pedal triangle when considering all points P inside the circumcircle of ABC. There are points P far away from the circumcircle for which the area of their pedal triangles is much larger. However, if you consider the signed area of the pedal triangle of P (of which sign depends on whether the points are in clockwise or anti-clockwise order), you could just say that the area of the pedal triangle of P is always negative whenever P is outside of the circumcircle so that P=X(3) gives the global maximum. (Mark Helman, July 10, 2020)
</p>
<p>
A slightly similar thing happens regarding the area of the antipedal triangle of P. P=X(4) has the smallest area of its antipedal amongst all P in the interior of triangle ABC (when X(4) is in this interior). There are points P (on the circumcircle) for which this area goes to 0. However, if we consider the signed area of the antipedal, even though there are still regions of the plane outside of ABC where the signed area is positive, P=X(4) gives the smallest area of the antipedal among all P for which this area is positive (this works even when ABC is obtuse, and points close to the circumcircle (on both sides) have negative antipedal area).

X(4) and the vertices A,B,C comprise an orthocentric system, defined as a set of four points, one of which is the orthocenter of the         triangle of the other three (so that each is the orthocenter of the other three). The incenter and excenters also form an orthocentric         system. If ABC is acute, then X(4) is the incenter of the orthic triangle.

Suppose P is not on a sideline of ABC. Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of P. Let D,E,F be the circles having diameters AA', BB',CC'.        The radical center of D,E,F is X(4). (Floor van Lamoen, Hyacinthos #214, Jan. 24, 2000.)

Let O<sub>A</sub> be the circle centered at the A-vertex of T and passing through A; define O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> cyclically.
