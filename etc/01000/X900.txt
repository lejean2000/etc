Let I<sub>a</sub> be the reflection of X(1) in the perpendicular bisector of BC, and define I<sub>b</sub> and I<sub>c</sub> cyclically; then X(900) = X(513) of I<sub>a</sub>I<sub>b</sub>I<sub>c</sub>.  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)

Let Ua be the line through X(80) perpendicular to the line AX(80), and define Ub and Uc cyclically.  Let Va be the reflection of BC in Ua, and define Vb and Vc cyclically.  The lines Va, Vb, Vc are parallel, and they concur in X(900).
