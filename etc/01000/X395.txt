<p>
X(395) is the center of the (equilateral) pedal triangle of X(16), as well as the circumcenter of the pedal triangle of X(14).
</p>
<p>
Let F = X(14), the 2nd Fermat point. Let Ab be the point on CA and Ac the point on AB such that FAbAc is an equilateral triangle. Let A' be the midpoint of FAbAc, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C', here named the <b>8th Fermat-Dao equilateral triangle</b>, is perspective to ABC. The circumcircle of A'B'C' is the pedal circle of X(14) and (X16), and the centroid of A'B'C' is X(395). The perspector of ABC and A'B'C' is X(2), and the centroid of A'B'C' is X(395).

X(395) is the pole of the Euler line wrt every conic passing through X(14), X(16), X(18) and X(62).  (Randy Hutson, January 17, 2020)
