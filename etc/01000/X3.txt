As a point on the Euler line, X(3) has Shinagawa coefficients (1, -1).
</p>
<p>
X(3) is the point of concurrence of the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of ABC. The lengths of segments AX, BX, CX are equal if and only if X = X(3). This common distance is the radius of the circumcircle, which passes through vertices A,B,C. Called the circumradius, it is given by R = a/(2 sin A) = abc/(4*area(ABC)).
</p>
<p>
The tangents at vertices of excentral triangle to the McCay cubic K003 concur in X(3).  Also, the tangents at A,B,C to the orthocubic K006 concur in X(3).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(4).  Let A&Prime; be X(4)-of-AB'C', and define B&Prime;, C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines A&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in X(3). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)

Let P be a point in the plane of ABC.  Let P' be the isogonal conjugate of P.  Let P" be the pedal antipodal perspector of P.  X(3) is the unique point P for which P' = P". (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p>
<p>
Taking a reference triangle ABC and a variable point P on the plane, P=X(3) is the point of maximal area of its pedal triangle when considering all points P inside the circumcircle of ABC. There are points P far away from the circumcircle for which the area of their pedal triangles is much larger. However, if you consider the signed area of the pedal triangle of P (of which sign depends on whether the points are in clockwise or anti-clockwise order), you could just say that the area of the pedal triangle of P is always negative whenever P is outside of the circumcircle so that P=X(3) gives the global maximum. (Mark Helman, July 10, 2020)
</p>
<p>
A slightly similar thing happens regarding the area of the antipedal triangle of P. P=X(4) has the smallest area of its antipedal amongst all P in the interior of triangle ABC (when X(4) is in this interior). There are points P (on the circumcircle) for which this area goes to 0. However, if we consider the signed area of the antipedal, even though there are still regions of the plane outside of ABC where the signed area is positive, P=X(4) gives the smallest area of the antipedal among all P for which this area is positive (this works even when ABC is obtuse, and points close to the circumcircle (on both sides) have negative antipedal area).

Let O be a point (not necessarily X(3)), and let be a AOB be a fixed-angle sector of a circle C=(O,R), rigidly rotating about center O. Let P be an arbitrary point. The locus of X(3)-of-PAB is a conic E whose major axis is OP. This conic is an ellipse (resp. hyperbola) if P is interior (resp. exterior) to C. One of its foci is O.
