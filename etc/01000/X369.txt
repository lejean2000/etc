        <p>If you have The Geometer's Sketchpad, you can view <a href="X(369).gsp" class="bold">X(369)</a>.

        <p>There exist points A', B', C' on segments BC, CA, AB, respectively,
        such that AB' + AC' = BC' + BA' = CA' + CB' = (a + b + c)/3, and the
        lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(369). Near the end of the 20th century,
        Yff found trilinears for X(369) in terms of the unique real root, r, of
        the cubic polynomial</p>
	<p>2t<sup>3</sup> - 3(a + b + c)t<sup>2</sup> + (a<sup>2</sup> +
        b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 8bc + 8ca + 8ab)t - (cb<sup>2</sup> +
        ac<sup>2</sup> + ba<sup>2</sup> + 5bc<sup>2</sup> + 5ca<sup>2</sup> +
        5ab<sup>2</sup> + 9abc),</p>
	<p>as follows: x = bc(r - c + a)(r - a + b). Here x(a,c,b) &ne;
        x(a,b,c), so that y and z are not obtained from x by cyclically
        permutating a,b,c. At the geometry conference held at Miami University
        of Ohio, October 2, 2004, Yff, proved that X(369) is also given by
        x<sub>1</sub> : y<sub>1</sub> : z<sub>1</sub> where y<sub>1</sub> :
        z<sub>1</sub> <i>are</i> given by cyclic permutations of a,b,c, in
        x<sub>1</sub>, where</p>
	<p>x<sub>1</sub> = bc[r<sup>2</sup> - (2c + a)r + (- a<sup>2</sup> +
        b<sup>2</sup> + 2c<sup>2</sup> + 2bc + 3ca + 2ab].</p>
	<p>His presentation included a proof that there is only one point for
        which AB' + AC' = BC' + BA' = CA' + CB' .</p>
