Let S = X(99). Let A' be the centroid of the triangle BCS, and define B' and C' cyclically. Let D' be the centroid of ABC. The four centroids form a quadrilateral homothetic to the quadrilateral ABCS.  The center of homothety is X(620), which is the centroid of ABCS.  (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

Let A'B'C' and A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; be the (equilateral) antipedal triangles of X(13) and X(14), resp.  Let A* be the midpoint of A' and A&Prime;, and define B* and C* cyclically.  The triangle A*B*C* is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(620).  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)

X(620) = center of the hyperbola H that is the locus of perspectors of circumconics centered at a point on line X(2)X(6), which is the locus of the X(2)-Ceva conjugate of P as P moves on line X(2)X(6).  Also, H is the Kiepert hyperbola of the medial triangle; H is tangent to line X(2)X(6) at X(2), and H passes X(3), X(39) and X(114).  H is also the bicevian conic of X(2) and X(99)  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)

X(620) is the center of the inellipse that is the barycentric square of line X(2)X(6).  The Brianchon point (perspector) of the inellipse is X(4590).  (Randy Hutson, October 15, 2018)

X(620) = midpoint of X(i) and X(j) for these (i,j): (3,114), (99,115), (187,325), (618,619)<br>
X(620) = complement of X(115)<br>
X(620) = X(187)-of-X(2)-Brocard-triangle<br>
X(620) = X(230)-of-1st-Brocard-triangle<br>
X(620) = isotomic conjugate of isogonal conjugate of X(20976)<br>
X(620) = polar conjugate of isogonal conjugate of X(22085)<br>
X(620) = centroid of X(2)X(3)X(114)X(2482)<br>
X(620) = Kosnita(X(99),X(2)) point<br>
X(620) = crosssum of intersections of 1st and 2nd Lemoine circles (and the circle {X(1687),X(1688),PU(1),PU(2)}})<br>
X(620) = QA-P29 center (Complement of QA-P2 wrt the Diagonal triangle) of quadrangle ABCX(2) (see http://www.chrisvantienhoven.nl/quadrangle-objects/15-mathematics/quadrangle-objects/artikelen-qa/57-qa-p29.html)<br>
