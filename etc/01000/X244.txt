Let O* be a circle with center X(3) and variable radius R*.  Let La be the radical axis of O* and the A-excircle, and define Lb and Lc cyclically. Let A'=Lb&cap;Lc, B'=Lc&cap;La, C'=La&cap;Lb.  Then A'B'C' is perspective to ABC, and the locus of the perspector as R* varies is the hyperbola {A,B,C,X(1),X(10)}}, which has center X(244).
Also, X(244) lies in the inellipse centered at X(10), as well as the Hofstadter ellpse E(1/2), which is the incentral inellipse.  (Randy Hutson, Decembe 26, 2016)
