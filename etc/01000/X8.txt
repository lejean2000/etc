Let A'B'C' be the points in which the A-excircle meets BC, the B-excircle meets CA, and the C-excircle meets AB, respectively. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(8). Another construction of A' is to start at A and trace around ABC half its perimeter, and similarly for B' and C'. Also, X(8) is the incenter of the anticomplementary triangle.

X(8) = perspector of ABC and the intouch triangle of the medial triangle of ABC. (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

Let Ab, Ac, Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb be as in the construction of the Conway circle (http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ConwayCircle.html).  Let Oa be the circumcircle of ABcCb, and define Ob, Oc cyclically.  X(8) is the radical center of Oa, Ob, Oc.  see also X(21) and X(274).  (Randy Hutson, April 9, 2016)

Let A'B'C' be Triangle T(-2,1).  Let A&Prime; be the trilinear product B'*C', and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines AA&Prime;, BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in X(519).  The lines A'A&Prime;, B'B&Prime;, C'C&Prime; concur in X(8).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let Ia be the reflection of X(1) in the perpendicular bisector of BC, and define Ib and Ic cyclically.  X(8) = X(1)-of-IaIbIc.  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)

Let A<sub>28</sub>B<sub>28</sub>C<sub>28</sub> be the Gemini triangle 28.  Let L<sub>A</sub> be the line through A<sub>28</sub> parallel to BC, and define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let A'<sub>28</sub> = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B'<sub>28</sub>, C'<sub>28</sub> cyclically.  Triangle A'<sub>28</sub>B'<sub>28</sub>C'<sub>28</sub> is homothetic to ABC at X(8).
