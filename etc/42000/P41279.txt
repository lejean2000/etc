As a sequel to the preamble just before X(6056), in which Lozada perspectors are introduced, this section is based on the following definition: Let A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub> be the cevian triangle of a point P = p : q : r (barycentrics) in the plane of a triangle ABC. Let L<sub>A</sub> be the line, other than BC, that passes through A<sub>1</sub> and is tangent to the A-excircle.  Let A' be the touch point, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is perspective to ABC, and the perspector, here named the <b>2nd Lozada perspector</b> of P, denoted by V(P), is given by
</p>
<p>
V(P) = (a + b - c)(a - b + c) p^2 : (b + c - a)(b - c + a) q^2 : (c + a - b)(c - a + b) r^2.

The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that V(X(i)) = X(j):
