Let K be a conic or circle and A, B, C three distinct and non-collinear points external to K. Let A', A" be the intersections of the line BC with the tangent lines to K through A. Build B', B" and C', C" cyclically. Then these six points lie on another conic K' (C&eacute;sar Lozada, September 23, 2020)

If ABC is acute and K is the nine-point-circle of ABC, then K' is a hyperbola through X(3005) and X(15451) and having center X(39799).
<br>
If K is the Spieker circle of ABC (i.e., the incircle of its medial triangle) then the center of K' is X(39800).
