<p>
Let ABC be a triangle on a plane XY. Consider three segments AA', BB', CC' with lengths U, V, W, respectively, and each having one fixed extreme in A, B and C, respectively, and the other extremes free to move outside the plane XY. Suppose that these segments are rotated around their fixed extremes in such a way that their free extremes coincide at a point D, forming, together with the sides of ABC, the edges of a tetrahedron ABCD. Let D*  be the orthogonal projection of D on the plane of ABC. The point D* is here named the <b>tetrahedral projection of ABC by (U, V, W)</b> or the <b>tetrahedral projection of ABC to A'B'C'</b>.
</p>
<p>
The point D* has barycentric coordinates:
<br>
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
D*  = a<sup>2</sup> (SA - U<sup>2</sup>) + SB W<sup>2</sup> + SC V<sup>2</sup> : b<sup>2</sup> (SB - V<sup>2</sup>) + SC U<sup>2</sup> + SA W<sup>2</sup> : c<sup>2</sup> (SC - W<sup>2</sup>) + SA V<sup>2</sup> + SB U<sup>2</sup> &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(1)
<br>
<br>
Z(D), the Z-coordinate of D , i.e., the height of the point D measured from D* and orthogonally to the plane of ABC, is given by:
<br>
<br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Z(D) = &plusmn;sqrt(&sum; [2 (a<sup>2</sup> U<sup>2</sup> + V<sup>2</sup> W<sup>2</sup>) SA - a<sup>2</sup> U<sup>4</sup>] - (a b c)<sup>2</sup>)/(2 S)
 &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(2)
</p>
<p>
Equation (2) shows that D is real or imaginary according to the sign of the quantity under the square root. If this quantity is zero then D and D* coincide on the plane of ABC. Moreover, the &plusmn; sign indicates that there are two possible points D and D', each in different sides with respect to the plane of ABC.
</p>
<p>
Equation (1) shows that if U, V, W are real numbers then D* is always real and also that, if U, V, W are cyclic values, i.e., if there exists a degree-1 function &fnof;(a,b,c) such that U=&fnof;(a,b,c), V=&fnof;(b,c,a) and W=&fnof;(c,a,b), then D* is a triangle center.
