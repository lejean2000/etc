Suppose that P = p : q : r (barycentrics) is a point in the plane of a triangle ABC. Suppose further that p,q,r are distinct homogeneous functions of a,b,c. The permutation ellipse of P, denoted by E(P), is introduced in the preamble just before X(34341) as the ellipse that passes through the six points p : q : r,    q : r : p,    r : p : q,    p : r : q,    q : p : r,   r : q : p, given by
</p>
<p>
(q r + r p + p q)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - (p^2 + q^2 + r^2)(y z + z x + x y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
The centroid, X(2), is the center and the perspector of E(P).

In C. Kimberling and P. Moses, 'Permutation Ellipses', <i>Journal for Geometry and Graphics</i> 24 (2020) 233-247, the following three special permutation ellipses are discussed: (1) trisector ellipse, (2) self-dual permutation ellipse; and (3) Steiner midway ellipse.  Following are definitions and equations:
</p>
<p>
(1) The trisector ellipse passes through the points 0:1:2, 0:2:1, 1:0:2, 2:0:1, 1:2:0, 2:1:0. These six points trisect the sides of ABC. The ellipse is given by 2(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)  - 5(y z + z x + x y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
(2) The unique self-dual permutation ellipse is given by x^2 + y^2 + z^2  - 4 (y z + z x + x y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
(3) The Steiner midway ellipse (SME), is, loosely speaking, the ellipse midway between the Steiner inellipse (SIE) and the Steiner circumellipse (SCE).  That is, for each P on SCE, let P' be the intersection of the ray GP with SIE, and let P'' be the midpoint of PP'.  Then SME is the set of all such midpoints. SME is given by 7(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)  - 34(y z + z x + x y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
In general, the inverse of a point P = p : q : r in an ellipse j (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - k (y z + z x + x y) = 0 is the point k*p^2 - j*p*q + j*q^2 - j*p*r - k*q*r + j*r^2 : : .
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (m,n) in the following list means that the trisector-ellipse-inverse of X(m) is X(n):
