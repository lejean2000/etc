Mappings g and h are defined in the preamble just before X(33628) as follows. Suppose that P = p : q : r is a point. The points
</p>
<p>
q - r : r - p : p - q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2p - q - r : 2q - r - p : 2r - p - q
</p>
<p>
clearly lie on the line at infinity, so that their isogonal conjugates,
</p>
<p>
g(P) = a^2/(q-r) : b^2/(r-p) : c^2/(p-q) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h(P) = a^2/(2p-q-r) : b^2/(2q-r-p) : c^2/(2r-p-q),
</p>
<p>
lie on the circumcircle.  Thus, if T is a central triangle, then g(T) and h(T) are central triangles inscribed in the circumcircle.
</p>
<p>
For many choices of triangle T, there are triangles T' such that T is perspective to h(T').  This section lists associated perspectors.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,T',i) in the following list means that T is perspective to h(T') and the perspector is X(i):
