Theorem: X(39624) is the unique major center on the line at infinity.
</p>
<p>
Proof (by Shourya Pandey):
</p>
<p>
First, suppose that f(A) : f(B) : f(C) is a major center on the line at infinity.  Then f(A) + f(B) + f(C) = 0. Define g(A) = f(A + &pi;/3), or equivalently, g(A - &pi;/3) = f(A). Let x = A - &pi;//3, y = B - &pi;/3, z = C - &pi;/3, so that x,y,z are real variables such that x + y + z = 0, and
</p>
<p>
g(x) + g(y) = -g(-x - y)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (*)
</p>
<p>
Putting x = y = 0 in (*) gives g(0) = 0, and putting y = -x in (*) shows that g is an odd function, so that
</p>
<p>
g(x) + g(y) = g(x + y)  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (**)
</p>
<p>
Equation (**) is the Cauchy functional equation, for which the only continuous solutions are g(x) = k*x. Thus, f(A) = k(A - &pi;/3), so that
</p>
<p>
f(A) : f(B) : f(C) = 3A - &pi; : 3B - &pi; : 3C - &pi; .
</p>
<p>
The method of proof shows that this solution is unique.
