This preamble is contributed by Clark Kimberling and Peter Moses, February 25, 2021.
<p>
</p>
<p>
Mappings g and h are defined in the preamble just before X(33628) as follows. Suppose that P = p : q : r is a point. The points
</p>
<p>
q - r : r - p : p - q&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2p - q - r : 2q - r - p : 2r - p - q
</p>
<p>
clearly lie on the line at infinity, so that their isogonal conjugates,
</p>
<p>
g(P) = a^2/(q-r) : b^2/(r-p) : c^2/(p-q) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h(P) = a^2/(2p-q-r) : b^2/(2q-r-p) : c^2/(2r-p-q),
</p>
<p>
lie on the circumcircle.  Thus, if T is a central triangle, then g(T) and h(T) are central triangles inscribed in the circumcircle.
</p>
<p>
For many choices of triangle T, there are triangles T' such that T is perspective to g(T').  This section lists associated perspectors.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,T',i) in the following list means that T is perspective to g(T') and the perspector is X(i):

Following are two examples of pairs, (T,T') of named triangles T and T' such that T = g(T'):
</p>
<p>
orthocentroidal triangle = g(cirum-symmedial triangle)<br>
1st cirumperp triangle = g(Gemini 7) = g(Gemini 15) = g(Gemini 17) = g(Gemini 25)
</p>
<p>
The appearance of T in the following list means that T is perspective to g(T) = 1st cirumperp triangle, and the perspector is X(3):
medial, tangential, 2nd circumperp, inner Napoleon, outer Napoleon, inner Fermat, outer Fermat, inner Vecten, outer Vecten, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, Fuhrmann, 1st Brocard, Kosnita, McCay, Trihn, reflection of ABC in X(5), Ara, 2nd Euler
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,i) in the following list means that T is perspectiive to g(T) = 1st cirumperp triangle, and the perspector is X(i):
</p>
<p>
(3rd Euler, 2), (4th Euler, 4), (intouch, 55), (hexyl, 40), (Yff central, 7589), (inner tangential mid-arc, 8075), (tangential of 1st circumperp, 11495), (tangential of 2nd circumperp, 12513),  (1st Sharygin, 4220), (2nd Sharygin, 105), (Honsberger, 7676), (2nd Pamfilos-Zhou, 8224),

</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,i)  in the following list means that T is perspective to g(T), and the persepctor is X(i):
</p>
<p>
(tangential,1627), (3rd Brocard, 32), (MacBeath, 25), (Thomson, 6), (anti-orthocentroidal, 110), (Wasat, 1691)
</p>
<p>
The locus of a point X such that for T = anticevian triangle of X, we have g(t) = T is the cubic K141; see

Bernard Gibert, <a href="https://bernard-gibert.pagesperso-orange.fr/Exemples/k141.html
">K141: pK(X(2),X(76))</a>.
</b>
</p>
<p>
The locus of a point X such that for T = cevian triangle of X, we have g(t) = T is the cubic pK(X(308), X(380)), which passes through X(i) for these i: 2, 76, 83, 264, 308, 1799, 17907.
