<p>
In the plane of a triangle ABC, let L be the line u x + v y + w z = 0, and let U be the point u : v : w, this being the isotomic conjugate of the trilinear pole of L. Let P = p : q : r be a point. The <b>(U,P)-cevapoint conic</b>, introduced here as the locus of X such that the cevapoint of P and X is on the line LU is given by
</p>
<p>
u (q x + p y)(r x + p z) + v (r x + q z)(p y + q x) + w (p y + r x)(q z + r y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
The center of the conic is the point
</p>
<p>
p*(p^2*(p - q - r) u^2 + q^2 (p - q + r) v^2 + r^2 (p + q - r) w^2 - 2 p q r v w + 2 p r (p - r) w u + 2 p q (p - q) u v) : : ,
</p>
<p>
and the perspector, by
</p>
<p>
p/(-p u + q r + r w) : q/(p u - q v + r w) : r/(p u + q v - r w).
</p>
<p>
For every point U, the (U,P)-cevapoint conic passes through the vertices of the anticevian triangle of P.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (i,j,k) in the following list means that the center of the (X(i),X(j))-cevapoint conic is X(k):
