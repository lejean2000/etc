In the plane of a triangle ABC, let L be the line u x + v y + w z = 0, and let U be the point u : v : w, this being the isotomic conjugate of the trilinear pole of L. Let P = p : q : r be a point. The <b>1st (U,P)-Ceva conic</b>, introduced here as the locus of X such that the P-Ceva conjugate of X is on the line L, is given by
</p>
<p>
u p (-p/x + q/y + r/z) + v q (p/x - q/y + r/z) + w r (p/x + q/y - r/z) = 0.
</p>
<p>
The center of the conic is the point
</p>
<p>
p (-p q^2 u v - 3 p q r u v + p q^2 v^2 - q^2 r v^2 - 3 p q r u w - p r^2 u w - 2 p q r v w - 3 q^2 r v w - 3 q r^2 v w + p r^2 w^2 - q r^2 w^2) : :
</p>
<p>
If U = X(2), then the center of the 1st (U,P)-Ceva conic is the complement of the complement of P, which is also the centroid of {A,B,C,P}, and also the center of the bicevian conic of X(2) and P.  (Randy Hutson, December 18, 2020)

The appearance of (i,j,k) in the following list means that the center of the 1st (X(i),X(j))-Ceva conic is X(k):
