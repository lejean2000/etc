This preamble and centers X(35096)-X(35098) were contributed by CÃ©sar Eliud Lozada, December 4, 2019.

<p>
If K1, K2 are two circumconics of ABC then the 4th intersection of K1 and K2 (other than A, B, C) is the trilinear pole wrt ABC of the line joining the perspectors of K1 and K2.

This is a list of the 4th points of intersection of some named conics:
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;X(4) = intersection, other than A, B, C, of these conics: Jerabek circumhyperbola and Kiepert hyperbola
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;X(110) = intersection, other than A, B, C, of these conics: Johnson circumconic and MacBeath circumconic
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;X(265) = intersection, other than A, B, C, of these conics: Jerabek circumhyperbola and Johnson circumconic
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;X(290) = intersection, other than A, B, C, of these conics: Jerabek circumhyperbola and Steiner circumellipse
<br>
&emsp;&emsp;X(648) = intersection, other than A, B, C, of these conics: MacBeath circumconic and Steiner circumellipse
