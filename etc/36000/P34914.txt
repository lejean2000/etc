Let P be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, and let A' be the point, other than P, in which the line AP meets the circle (PBC). Define B' and C' cyclically. The triangle A'B'C' is called the <b>circlecevian triangle of P</b> with respect to triangle ABC  by Floor van Lamoen ( Hyacinthos # 10039).

<p>
Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC, and let A0 = BC&cap;IA'; define B0 and C0 cyclically. Then AA0, BB0, CC0 concur in a point, T(P), here named the <b>Vu T-transform of P</b>.  Barycentrics are given by

<p>
T(P) = p / (b*c*p^2 + b*c*p* q + c^2*p*q + b^2*p*r + b*c*p*r + a^2*q*r) .

The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that T(X(i)) = X(j):
