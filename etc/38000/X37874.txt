There are two parabolas having focus A and axis AB and passing through C; these parabolas also meet AC in two more points, denoted by A<sub>c1</sub> and A<sub>c2</sub>.  Likewise there are two parabolas having focus A, axis AC, and passing through B.  They also meet in two other points on AB, denoted by A<sub>b1</sub> and A<sub>b2</sub>.  The diagonal points of the complete quadrangle A<sub>b1</sub>A<sub>b2</sub>A<sub>c1</sub>A<sub>c2</sub> are A, the infinity point of BC, and a third point, denoted by A'.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  The parallels through A',B',C' to BC, CA, AB, respectively, form a triangle A"B"C" that is homothetic to ABC.  The homothetic center is X(37874).
