Preamble based on notes from Peter Moses, March 14, 2020.
<p>
Dan Reznik has shown that the circumellipse ellipse with center X(9) has many interesting geometric properties. As stated at X(9),
</p>
<p>
Let E be the circumellipse of T = ABC with center X(9).  Then ABC is a billiard orbit of E(3-periodic). If we fix E in the plane, all its triangular orbits (a set of "rotating" triangles T) have the same X(9). Note that X(9) is the point of concurrence of lines drawn from each excenter to the midpoint of the corresponding side of T. (Dan Reznik, June 30, 2019)  See [1]

<p>
Certain lines are mapped onto E by barycentric quotients:
</p>
<p>
If P lies on the line at infinity, then X(1)/P lies on E.<br>
If P lies on the Euler line, then X(1)/(P*X(525)) lies on E.<br>
If P lies on the Brocard axis, then X(1)/(P*X(850)) lies on E.<br>
</p>
<p>
If P lies on the circumcircle, then P/X(1) lies on E.<br>
E = isogonal conjugate of the antiorthic axis.<br>
E = trilinear pole of the line X(1)P.
