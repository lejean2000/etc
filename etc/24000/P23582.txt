Several weeks before the appearance of this preamble on September 29, 2018, Clark Kimberling and Peter Moses, and independently, Randy Hutson, developed the notion of (pointwise) squares and cubes of points on lines, and they computed examples found below. Centers X(23582)-X(23594) were contributed by Kimberling and Moses, and X(23962)-X(24041) by Hutson.  The latter are in two groups: X(23962)-X(23992) (barycentrc squares) and X(23993)-X(24041) (trilinear)  See the preambles just before X(23962) and X(23993).

Suppose that P = p : q : r (barycentrics) is a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, not on a sideline BC, CA, AB.  Let L be the trilinear polar of P, so that L meets the sidelines in 0 : q : -r, -p : 0 : r, p : -q : 0.  The barycentric squares of these points are the points A' = 0 : q^2 : r^2,  B' = p^2 : 0 : r^2, C' = p^2 : q^2 : 0.  The perspector of A'B'C' and ABC is the barycentric square P^2 = p^2 : q^2 : r^2, so that P^2 is the perspector of the inellipse that is the locus of squares of points on L.  The center of the ellipse is the point p^2 (q^2 + r^2) : q^2 (r^2 + p^2) : r^2 (p^2 + q^2), which is the X(2)-crosspoint of P^2, as well as the complement of the isotomic conjugate of P^2.  The ellipse is here named the <b>barycentric square of L.</b>

The appearance of (L,i,j,k) in the following list means that L is the trilinear polar of X(i), and the associated inellipse has perspector X(j) and center X(k):

More generally, if m is a regular collineation, then the locus of m(P^2), as P traverses L, is an inellipse of the triangle m(A)m(B)m(C)..
