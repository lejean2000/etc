The following discussion is analogous to the preambles just before X(23582) and X(23962).

Suppose that P = p : q : r (trilinears) is a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, not on a sideline BC, CA, AB. Let L be the trilinear polar of P, so that L meets the sidelines in 0 : q : -r, -p : 0 : r, p : -q : 0. The trilinear squares of these points are the points A' = 0 : q^2 : r^2, B' = p^2 : 0 : r^2, C' = p^2 : q^2 : 0. The perspector of A'B'C' is the trilinear square P^2, so that P^2 = p^2 : q^2 : r^2 is the perspector of the inellipse that is the locus of squares of points on L. The center of the ellipse is the point p^2(q^2 + r^2) : q^2(r^2 + p^2) : r^2(p^2 + q^2), which is the X(2)-crosspoint of P^2, as well as the complement of the isotomic conjugate of P^2. The ellipse is here named the <b>trilinear square of L</b>.

Let E be the inellipse that is the trilinear square of L.  The vertex conjugate of the foci of E is the point a^2 p^2 : b^2 q^2 : c^2 r^2.  Let U = u : v : w and X = x : y : z be points on L so that U^2 and X^2 lie on E.  The trilinear pole of the tangent to E at U^2 is the trilinear product P*U = p*u : q*v : r*w, which lies on the trilinear polar of the Brianchon point (perspector) of E.  The intersection of the tangents to E at U^2 and X^2 is the trilinear product U*X = u*x : v*y : w*z.
