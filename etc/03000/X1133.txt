Rotate line BC about B away from A through angle B/3, and rotate line BC about C away from A through angle C/3; let A' be the point in which the two rotated lines meet. Define B' and C' cyclically. Let A" be the point of intersection of lines BC' and B'C, and define B" and C" cyclically. The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(357), and AA", BB", CC" concur in X(358). The first of these with reference to triangle A'B'C' is X(1133); i.e., X(1133) = X(357)-of-A'B'C'.
