Suppose that P is a point on the circumcircle &Gamma; of triangle ABC.
Let U and V be the lines through P tangent to the incircle. Line U
meets &Gamma; in a point U' other than P, and line V meets &Gamma; in a
point V' other than P. The line U'V' is tangent to the incircle. The
touchpoint, denoted by T(P), is the Brisse transform of P. Suppose P is
given by barycentrics u : v : w. <b>Barycentrics for T(P)</b> are found
in
<p><B>Edward Brisse, <a href="http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2001volume1/FG200103.pdf">Perspective
Poristic Triangles</a></B>:  a<sup>4</sup>/[(b + c - a)u<sup>2</sup>] : b<sup>4</sup>/[(c
+ a - b)v<sup>2</sup>] : c<sup>4</sup>/[(a + b - c)w<sup>2</sup>].
</p>

<p>If X is given by trilinears x : y : z, then T(X) has trilinears a/[(b + c - a)x<sup>2</sup>] :
b/[(c + a - b)y<sup>2</sup>] : c/[(a + b - c)z<sup>2</sup>].</p>

<p>
Examples: X(11) = Feuerbach point = T(X(109))<br>
X(1317) = incircle-antipode of X(11) = T(X(106))
</p>

<p><b>Still open</b> is the question posed in Hyacinthos #6832: to list
<i>all</i> polynomial centers on the incircle having low degree and to
prove that there are no others. Here, "degree" of X = p(a,b,c) :
p(b,c,a) : p(c,a,b) [barycentrics] refers to the degree of homogeneity
of p(a,b,c), and "low" means less than 6. (The Feuerbach point, X(11),
has degree 3.)</p>

<p>In Hyacinthos #6835, Paul Yiu gives two methods for constructing
polynomial centers on the incircle:</p>

<p>(1) If X is a polynomial center on the incircle and W is any other
polynomial center, then the line XW meets the incircle in another point
that is a polynomial center.</p>

<p>(2) If W is on the line at infinity, then the barycentric square
W<sup>2</sup> is on the Steiner inscribed ellipse, and the barycentric
product X(7)*W<sup>2</sup> is on the incircle.</p>
