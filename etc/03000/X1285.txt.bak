<p>X(1285) is the homothetic center of the antipedal triangle of X(2)
and the pedal triangle of X(6). (Darij Grinberg, Hyacinthos #6577,
2/21/03). See also X(3066).</p>

<p>Let T denote the antipedal triangle of X(2), and let T(m) denote
X(m)-of-T. Then T(m) is a triangle center of the reference triangle
ABC. The appearance of (m,n) in the following list means that T(m) =
X(n). Note the special case m = 1285.</p>

Let A'B'C' be the antipedal triangle of X(2).  The centroid of A'B'C' is X(376).  Let A"B"C" be the antipedal triangle, wrt A'B'C', of X(376).  A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(1285).  (Randy Hutson, March 21, 2019)

Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of X(6).  Let K' be X(6) of A'B'C'.  Let A"B"C" be the pedal triangle, wrt A'B'C', of K'.  A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(1285).  (Randy Hutson, March 21, 2019)

If ABC is a triangle, P is a point, and A', B', C' are the reflections
of A, B, C in P, then the circumcircles of triangles AB'C', A'BC' and
A'B'C concur at a point Q on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The
transformation T given by Q = T(P) was described by
<p><b>S. N. Collings,</b> "Reflections on reflections 2",
<i>Mathematical Gazette</i> 1974, page 264.</p>

<p>It was further discussed by Floor van Lamoen and Darij Grinberg, and
coordinates were found by Barry Wolk; see Hyacinthos #4547, #4548,
#6469, #6538, #6546, #6560. Paul Yiu noted that T(P) is the point,
other than A, B, C, in which the circumconic centered at P meets the
circumcircle of triangle ABC (#4548).</p>

<p>If P = x : y : z (trilinears), then Q = f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) :
f(c,a,b), where</p>

<p>f(a,b,c) = 1/[bz(ax + by - cz) - cy(ax + cz - by)].</p>

<p>For given Q, the set of points P satisfying T(P) = Q is a conic.
Examples follow:</p>

<p>if Q = X(74), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 125;<br>
if Q = X(98), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 115, 868;<br>
if Q = X(99), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 2, 39, 114, 618,
619, 629, 630, 641, 642, 1125;<br>
if Q = X(100), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 1, 9, 10, 119,
142, 214, 442, 1145;<br>
if Q = X(107), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 4, 133, 800,
1249;<br>
if Q = X(110), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 5, 6, 113, 141,
206, 942, 960, 1147, 1209;<br>
if Q = X(476), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 30.</p>

<p>Bernard Gibert (4/02/03) identified T(P) as the trilinear pole of
the line of X(6) and the X(2)-Ceva conjugate of P. He identified the
locus of P as the rectangular hyperbola that circumscribes the medial
triangle and has center W given by the vector equation 4X(2)W = X(2)Q.
The anticomplement of this hyperbola is the rectangular
ABC-circumhyperbola whose center is the complement of Q. Thus,
referring to examples given above:</p>

<p>if Q = X(99), the conic is the Kiepert hyperbola of the medial
triangle;<br>
if Q = X(100), the conic is the Feuerbach hyperbola of the medial
triangle;<br>
if Q = X(110), the conic is the Jerabek hyperbola of the medial
triangle.</p>
