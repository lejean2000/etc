If ABC is a triangle, P is a point, and A', B', C' are the reflections
of A, B, C in P, then the circumcircles of triangles AB'C', A'BC' and
A'B'C concur at a point Q on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. The
transformation T given by Q = T(P) was described by
<p><b>S. N. Collings,</b> "Reflections on reflections 2",
<i>Mathematical Gazette</i> 1974, page 264.</p>

<p>It was further discussed by Floor van Lamoen and Darij Grinberg, and
coordinates were found by Barry Wolk; see Hyacinthos #4547, #4548,
#6469, #6538, #6546, #6560. Paul Yiu noted that T(P) is the point,
other than A, B, C, in which the circumconic centered at P meets the
circumcircle of triangle ABC (#4548).</p>

<p>If P = x : y : z (trilinears), then Q = f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) :
f(c,a,b), where</p>

<p>f(a,b,c) = 1/[bz(ax + by - cz) - cy(ax + cz - by)].</p>

<p>For given Q, the set of points P satisfying T(P) = Q is a conic.
Examples follow:</p>

<p>if Q = X(74), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 125;<br>
if Q = X(98), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 115, 868;<br>
if Q = X(99), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 2, 39, 114, 618,
619, 629, 630, 641, 642, 1125;<br>
if Q = X(100), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 1, 9, 10, 119,
142, 214, 442, 1145;<br>
if Q = X(107), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 4, 133, 800,
1249;<br>
if Q = X(110), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 5, 6, 113, 141,
206, 942, 960, 1147, 1209;<br>
if Q = X(476), the conic passes through X(i) for I = 30.</p>

<p>Bernard Gibert (4/02/03) identified T(P) as the trilinear pole of
the line of X(6) and the X(2)-Ceva conjugate of P. He identified the
locus of P as the rectangular hyperbola that circumscribes the medial
triangle and has center W given by the vector equation 4X(2)W = X(2)Q.
The anticomplement of this hyperbola is the rectangular
ABC-circumhyperbola whose center is the complement of Q. Thus,
referring to examples given above:</p>

<p>if Q = X(99), the conic is the Kiepert hyperbola of the medial
triangle;<br>
if Q = X(100), the conic is the Feuerbach hyperbola of the medial
triangle;<br>
if Q = X(110), the conic is the Jerabek hyperbola of the medial
triangle.</p>
