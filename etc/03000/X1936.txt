X(1936) is the perspector of triangle ABC and the tangential triangle of the conic that passes through A, B, C, and the pair P(16) and U(16) of bicentric points; This conic also passes through X(21) and X(651); see the notes just before X(1908).  (Randy Hutson, 9/23/2011)

Let L  be the line X(1)X(3) = trilinear polar of X(651).  Let V be the trilinear polar of the cevapoint of X(1) and X(3), so that V = X(521)X(650); let M = X(3157) = X(1)-Ceva conjugate of X(3), and let N = X(1745) =  X(3)-Ceva conjugate of X(1).  The lines L, V, MN concur in X(1936).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)

Let A1B1C1 and A2B2C2 be the 1st and 2nd bicentrics of the orthic triangle.                The six vertices A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2 lie on a conic, denoted here by H.  Let A' be the intersection of the tangents to H at A1 and A2.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(1936).  Let A" be the intersection of the tangents to H at B2 and C1.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(1936).    (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)
