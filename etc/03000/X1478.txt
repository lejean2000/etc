The Johnson Circle Theorem is the fact that if three congruent
circles intersect in a point, then the circle passing through the other
three intersections is congruent to them. This fourth circle is the
Johnson circle of the three given circles. There are three congruent
circles each tangent to two sides of triangle ABC. Peter Yff proved
that their Johnson circle has center X(1478). The circle is here named
the Johnson-Yff circle of the triangle.</p>
