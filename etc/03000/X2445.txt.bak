Centers X(2446) to X(2573) were contributed by Peter J. C. Moses during
October to November, 2003. See the notes just before X(1662) for an
introduction and notation.

<p>Included in this section are centers of similitude of several pairs
of circles. However, for some pairs of central circles, the two centers
of similitudes are not triangle centers but are instead a pair of
bicentric points. Specifically, Moses found that the insimilicenter
(i.e., internal center of similitude) and exsimilicenter of the
following pairs are bicentric points; as such they are listed in the
Bicentric Pairs section (accessed by the <b>Tables</b> button atop this
page):</p>

<p>{Parry circle and 2nd Lemoine circle}; see P(62) in Bicentric
Pairs<br>
{Parry circle and circumcircle}; P(63)<br>
{Parry circle and incircle}; P(64)<br>
{Parry circle and nine-point circle}; P(65)<br>
{Parry circle and Spieker circle}; P(66)<br>
{Parry circle and Moses circle}; P(67)</p>

<p>The 2nd Brocard circle, defined in the aforementioned Bicentric
Pairs, is mentioned several times [from X(2554) to X(2573)]. A summary
of its properties follows.</p>

<p><b>Definition:</b> The <i>2nd Brocard circle</i> is the circle
having center X(3) and radius eR, where e = (1 - 4
sin<sup>2</sup>&omega;)<sup>1/2</sup> and R = circumradius. The 2nd
Brocard circle and the Brocard circle meet in the 1st and 2nd Brocard
points. Peter J. C. Moses found that the 2nd Brocard circle also passes
through the points X(i) for I = 1670, 1671, 2554, 2555, 2556, 2557. The
square of the radius of the 2nd Brocard circle can be written out
as</p>

<p></p>
a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>(a<sup>4</sup> +
b<sup>4</sup> + c <sup>4</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> -
c<sup>2</sup>a<sup>2</sup> -
a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>)/[4(b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> +
c<sup>2</sup>a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>)(a<sup>2</sup>
+ b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>)]
<p></p>
<br>
X(i) is the inverse-in-the-2nd-Brocard-circle of X(j) for these (i,j):
(6,39), (76,99), (1666,2563), (1667,2562), (1689,1690), (2026,2561),
(2027,2560)
<p>The power of the 2nd Brocard circle with respect to each of the
vertices A, B, C is
a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>/(b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup> +
c<sup>2</sup>a<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>b<sup>2</sup>)</p>
