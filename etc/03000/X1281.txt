<blockquote>
    We will treat two remarkable triangles: the triangle bounded by the
    perpendicular bisectors of the internal angle bisectors of a
    triangle ABC, and the triangle bounded by the perpendicular
    bisectors of the external angle bisectors of triangle ABC. These
    two triangles and the triangle ABC are three perspective triangles,
    having a common perspectrix: the Lemoine axis of ABC. The mutual
    perspectors of the three triangles will be called the first, second
    and third Sharygin points of ABC (after a problem of Igor Sharygin
    - see Section 10).
</blockquote>
The report introduces fifteen Sharygin points, of which
the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th are X(256), X(291), X(846),<br>
and X(1054), respectively. X(1281) is the 3rd Sharygin point. See also
Hyacinthos #6293 and #6315.
<p>Let A' be the point where the internal angle bisector of angle CAB
meets line BC, and let A" be the point where the external angle
bisector of angle CAB meets line BC. Let x be the perpendicular
bisector of segment AA', and let x' be the perpendicular bisector of
segment AA". Define y, z, y', z' cyclically. Let D be the point where
lines y and z meet, and let D' be the point where lines y' and z' meet.
Define E, F, E', F' cyclically. Then</p>
<p>X(1281) = points of concurrence of lines DD', EE', FF'<br>
X(846) = homothetic center of the excentral triangle and triangle
DEF<br>
X(1054) = center of similitude of the excentral triangle and triangle
D'E'F'.</p>
<p>X(1281) lies on the Yff contact circle and these lines:

X(1281) = isogonal conjugate of X(30648)<br>
X(1281) = perspector of unary cofactor triangles of Gemini triangles 33 and 34<br>
X(1281) = crossdifference of every pair of points on line X(5029)X(30654)<br>
X(1281) = X(1)-of-1st-anti-Brocard-triangle<br>
X(1281) = perspector of (cross-triangle of ABC and 1st Sharygin triangle) and (cross-triangle of ABC and 2nd Sharygin triangle)<br>
