<h3 id="X1658">X(1658)&nbsp;=&nbsp;CIRCUMCENTER OF KOSNITA TRIANGLE</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; cos(B - C) + 4 cos 2A cos B cosC : : (Nikolaos Dergiades, Hyacinthos 7752)
<p>
As a point on the Euler line, X(1658) has Shinagawa coefficients (E + 8F, -3E - 8F).

The vertices of the Kosnita triangle are the circumcenters of the
triangles BOC, COA, AOB, where O is the circumcenter, X(3). (Darij
Grinberg, 8/24/03)
</p>
<p>
Let La be the polar of X(4) wrt the circle centered at A and passing through X(3), and define Lb, Lc cyclically.  (Note: X(4) is the perspector of any circle centered at a vertex of ABC.)  Let A" = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B" and C" cyclically.  Triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, and its nine-point center is X(1658).  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)
