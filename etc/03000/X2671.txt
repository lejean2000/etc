Suppose UV is a segment and 1/2 &lt; s &lt; 1. Let P be the point on
UV satisfying |UP|/|VP| = s. Let O be a semicircle having diameter UV.
Let H be the semicircle having diameter VP, on the same side of UV as
O. Let K be the semicircle having diameter UP, on the same side of UP
as O. The three circular arcs form an <i>arbelos</i>, R.</p>

<p>Let L be the line through P perpendicular to BC. The circle tangent
to semicircles O and K and line L is the <i>s-Archimedean circle</i> of
the arbelos R. Now continuing with the variable s, suppose ABC is an
arbitrary triangle. Let A' be the center of the s-Archimedean circle of
the outward arbelos on segment BC, and define B' and C' cyclically.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold">At the Eleventh International Conference
on Fibonacci Numbers and Their Applications (TU Braunschweig, Germany,
July 2004), Zvonko Cerin established that the lines AA', BB', CC'
concur if and only if s = &tau;. The point of concurrence is
X(2671).</p>
