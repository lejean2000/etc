<p>In his book <span class="title">The Modern Geometry of the Triangle,</span> 2nd edition
(Francis Hodgson, London, 1913), William Gallatly, on page 117,
introduces the pedal cicle of the 1st and 2nd Brocard points. The
circle is here named the Gallatly circle. Its center is the Brocard
midpoint, X(39), and the radius, R sin &omega;, where &omega; denotes
the Brocard angle, given by
</p>
<p>
tan &omega; = 4[area(ABC)]/(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> +
c<sup>2</sup>).
</p>
<p>Other special symbols used in this section are identified just before X(1662).
</p>
<p>
Centers X(2007)-X(2040) were contributed with coordinates by Peter J. C. Moses during September, 2003. For centers of similitude of the Gallatly circle and the circumcircle, see X(1689) and X(1690); for
those of the Gallatly circle and the 2nd Lemoine circle, see X(1671)
and X(1670).</p>
