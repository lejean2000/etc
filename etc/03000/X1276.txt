<p>Let T be the excentral triangle, whose vertices are the A-, B-, C-
excenters of triangle ABC. Let U be the equilateral triangle having
segment BC as base with vertex A' on the side of BC that does not
contain vertex A. Define B' and C' cyclically, and let T' be the
triangle A'B'C'. Let V be the equilateral triangle having BC as base
with vertex A" on the side of BC that contains A. Define B" and C"
cyclically, and let T" = A"B"C". Then T and T' are perspective, and
X(1276) is their perspector. (Lawrence Evans, 2/4/2003)</p>

<p>Evans conjectured that X(1), X(484), X(1276), X(1277) are concyclic,
and he reported that Paul Yiu confirmed this conjecture and noted that
the center of this circle is X(1019). (Lawrence Evans, 2/24/2003)</p>

<p>X(1276) is the perspector of the excentral triangle and the apices
of equilateral triangles constructed outward from the sides, as in the
construction of X(13). More generally, the excentral triangle is
perspective to every Kiepert triangle. The locus of the perspector
K<sub>&theta;</sub> is the line X(4)X(9). Specifically,
K<sub>&theta;</sub> divides the segment from X(75) to X(9) in the ratio
- ((4R+r)/s) cot &theta;. (Paul Yiu, 2/27/04).</p>
<p>X(1276) lies on the Neuberg cubic and these lines: 1,15&nbsp;&nbsp;
4,9&nbsp;&nbsp; 14,484&nbsp;&nbsp; 63,616</p>
<p>
X(1276) = reflection of X(1277) in X(5011)<br>
X(1276) = anticomplement of X(33397)<br>
X(1276) = X(16)-of-excentral-triangle<br>
X(1276) = inverse-in-Bevan-circle of X(1277) (noted by Peter J. C. Moses, Sept. 8, 2004)<br>
