Let P(2) and U(2) be the 1st and 2nd Beltrami points (as indexed at
Bicentric Pairs, accessible using the Tables button at the top of ETC),
and let P(40) and U(40) be the isogonal conjugates of P(2) and U(2),
respectively. Then X(2966) is the point of intersection of the lines
P(2)U(40) and P(40)U(2). (Peter Moses, July 1, 2009). See also
X(3568).

The MacBeath inconic is the conic inscribed in triangle ABC having
center X(5) and foci X(3) and X(4). An equation for this conic in
barycentric coordinates is
<p></p>
u<sup>2</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + v<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup> +
w<sup>2</sup>z<sup>2</sup> - 2wvyz - 2wuzx - 2uvxy = 0,
<p></p>
<br>
where (u, v, w) = (sin 2A, sin 2B, sin 2C), i.e., u : v : w = X(3).
<p>In the parlance of TCCT, page 238, the MacBeath inconic is
W(X(184)), with trilinear equation</p>

<p></p>
U<sup>2</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + V<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup> +
W<sup>2</sup>z<sup>2</sup> - 2WVyz - 2WUzx - 2UVxy = 0,
<p></p>
<br>
where U : V : W = X(184) = a<sup>2</sup>cos A : b<sup>2</sup>cos B :
c<sup>2</sup>cos C.
<p>Points lying on the MacBeath inconic were contributed by Peter Moses
(Hyacinthos, Nov. 12, 2004), and a selection of these are given here as
X(2967) to X(2973). Comments written by Alexander Murray MacBeath are
given in a Hyacinthos message of Dec. 12, 2004 from Antreas P.
Hatzipolakis. See also <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MacBeathInconic.html" style=
"font-style: italic">MathWorld</a> and more than a dozen Hyacinthos
messages numbered between 10870 and 10923.
</p>

<p>Macbeath authored articles entitled "The Deltoid I," The Deltoid
II," and "The Deltoid III," in <i>Eureka</i>. In the second of these,
11 (1949) 26-29, he introduces the conic as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    Lemma 1: Let O, H be the common points of a coaxal system of
    circles. Let a variable circle of the system cut the line of
    centres at C. Let T be a point on the circumference such that
    TC=k*OC, where k is a fixed ratio. Then the locus of T is a conic
    with foci at O,H.
</blockquote>
In Hyacinthos message 2009, dated Dec. 9, 2000, John
Conway wrote
<blockquote>
    This I know as "the MacBeath ellipse", since Murray MacBeath wrote
    a nice article about it in "Eureka", the Cambridge University
    undergraduate mathematical journal.
</blockquote>
Thus did the conic get its name. Points X(339), X(1312),
and X(1313) lie on the MacBeath inconic. Peter Moses (Nov. 12, 2004)
noted that if X is on this conic, then the reflection of X in X(5), and
also the reflection of X in the Euler line, lie on the conic. He
introduced the MacBeath circumconic, dual to the MacBeath inconic. The
circumconic is given in barycentrics by
<p></p>
(sin 2A)yz + (sin 2B)zx + (sin 2C)xy = 0,
<p></p>
<br>
and in trilinears by
<p></p>
(cos A)yz + (cos B)zx + (cos C)xy = 0,
<p></p>
<br>
and it passes through X(i) for I = 110, 287, 648, 651, 677, 895, 1331,
1332, 1797, 1813, 1814, 1815.
