X(1691) is the perspector of ABC and the reflection of the tangential triangle in the Lemoine axis (i.e., the reflection of the anticevian triangle of X(6) in the trilinear polar of X(6)).  (Randy Hutson, September 5, 2015)

Let A'B'C' be the 1st anti-Brocard triangle.  X(1691) is the radical center of the circumcircles of A'BC, B'CA, C'AB.  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

<p>
Let A' be the circumcircle intercept, other than A, of the A-Montesdeoca-Lemoine circle.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is perspective to the symmedial triangle at X(1691).  (Randy Hutson, July 11, 2019)
