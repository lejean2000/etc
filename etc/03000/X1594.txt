Traian Lalescu (Trajan Lalesco) proved in "A Class of Remarcable
Triangles," <i>Gazeta Matematica</i> 20 (1915) 213 [in Romanian], that
if triangles DEF and D'E'F' are inscribed in a circle and directed
arclengths satisfyarc DD' + arc EE' + arc FF' = 0 mod 2&pi;,
then the Simson lines of D,E,F with respect to D',E',F' and the Simson
lines of D',E',F' with respect to D,E,F concur in the midpoint X of the
segment of the orthocenters of DEF and D'E'F'. Daniel Vacaretu
considered triangles DEF and D'E'F' associated with left and right
isoscelizers and inscribed in the sine-triple-angle circle. He obtained
the second set of trilinears shown above for the midpoint X. (See also
the bicentric pair PU(61).)
<p>In <i>Episodes in Nineteenth and Twentieth Century Euclidean
Geometry,</i>, page 132, Ross Honsberger presents X(1594) as the
orthopole of the six sides of two triangles and as the point common to
six Simson lines. Honsberger calls this orthopole the Rigby Point.
