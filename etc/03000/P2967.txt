The MacBeath inconic is the conic inscribed in triangle ABC having
center X(5) and foci X(3) and X(4). An equation for this conic in
barycentric coordinates is
</p>
u<sup>2</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + v<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup> +
w<sup>2</sup>z<sup>2</sup> - 2wvyz - 2wuzx - 2uvxy = 0,
</p>
<br>
where (u, v, w) = (sin 2A, sin 2B, sin 2C), i.e., u : v : w = X(3).
<p>In the parlance of TCCT, page 238, the MacBeath inconic is
W(X(184)), with trilinear equation</p>

</p>
U<sup>2</sup>x<sup>2</sup> + V<sup>2</sup>y<sup>2</sup> +
W<sup>2</sup>z<sup>2</sup> - 2WVyz - 2WUzx - 2UVxy = 0,
</p>
<br>
where U : V : W = X(184) = a<sup>2</sup>cos A : b<sup>2</sup>cos B :
c<sup>2</sup>cos C.
<p>Points lying on the MacBeath inconic were contributed by Peter Moses
(Hyacinthos, Nov. 12, 2004), and a selection of these are given here as
X(2967) to X(2973). Comments written by Alexander Murray MacBeath are
given in a Hyacinthos message of Dec. 12, 2004 from Antreas P.
Hatzipolakis. See also <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MacBeathInconic.html" style=
"font-style: italic">MathWorld</a> and more than a dozen Hyacinthos
messages numbered between 10870 and 10923.
</p>

<p>Macbeath authored articles entitled "The Deltoid I," The Deltoid
II," and "The Deltoid III," in <i>Eureka</i>. In the second of these,
11 (1949) 26-29, he introduces the conic as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
    Lemma 1: Let O, H be the common points of a coaxal system of
    circles. Let a variable circle of the system cut the line of
    centres at C. Let T be a point on the circumference such that
    TC=k*OC, where k is a fixed ratio. Then the locus of T is a conic
    with foci at O,H.
</blockquote>
In Hyacinthos message 2009, dated Dec. 9, 2000, John
Conway wrote
<blockquote>
    This I know as "the MacBeath ellipse", since Murray MacBeath wrote
    a nice article about it in "Eureka", the Cambridge University
    undergraduate mathematical journal.
</blockquote>
Thus did the conic get its name. Points X(339), X(1312),
and X(1313) lie on the MacBeath inconic. Peter Moses (Nov. 12, 2004)
noted that if X is on this conic, then the reflection of X in X(5), and
also the reflection of X in the Euler line, lie on the conic. He
introduced the MacBeath circumconic, dual to the MacBeath inconic. The
circumconic is given in barycentrics by
</p>
(sin 2A)yz + (sin 2B)zx + (sin 2C)xy = 0,
</p>
<br>
and in trilinears by
</p>
(cos A)yz + (cos B)zx + (cos C)xy = 0,
</p>
<br>
and it passes through X(i) for I = 110, 287, 648, 651, 677, 895, 1331,
1332, 1797, 1813, 1814, 1815.
