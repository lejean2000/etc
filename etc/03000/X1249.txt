X(1249) is the perspector of triangle ABC and the tangential
triangle of the circumconic centered at X(4). X(1249) is also the
perspector of the medial triangle and the triangle formed by the
trilinear poles of the sidelines of the orthic triangle. (Randy Hutson,

X(1249) is the unique point whose anticomplement is also its polar conjugate, namely X(253). (Randy Hutson, March 14, 2018)

Let Ea be the ellipse with B and C as foci and passing through X(4), and define Eb and Ec cyclically.<br>
Let La be the line tangent to Ea at X(4), and define Lb and Lc cyclically.<br>
Let A' be the trilinear pole of line La, and define B' and C' cyclically.<br>
Then A', B', C' lie on the circumconic centered at X(1249). (Randy Hutson, March 14, 2018)

<p>
Let A'B'C' be the medial triangle.  Let A" be the pole, wrt the polar circle, of line B'C', and define B" and C" cyclically. Also, A"B"C" is the triangle formed by trilinear poles of sides of the orthic triangle.  The lines A'A", B'B", C'C" concur in X(1249). (Randy Hutson, March 14, 2018)

X(1249) lies on hyperbola {{X(2),X(6),X(216),X(233),X(1249),X(1560),X(3162)}}.  This hyperbola is a circumconic of the medial triangle, and the locus of perspectors of circumconics centered at a point on the Euler line.  The hyperbola is tangent to Euler line at X(2).
