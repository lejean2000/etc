    This section consists of the endo-homothetic centers of the family of triangles homothetic with the orthic triangle of a reference triangle ABC. This family is composed by the following 37 triangles: <br>
    <br>
    anti-Ascella, anti-Atik, 1st anti-circumperp, anti-Conway, 2nd anti-Conway, 3rd anti-Euler, 4th anti-Euler, anti-excenters-reflections, 2nd anti-extouch, anti-Honsberger, anti-Hutson intouch, anti-incircle-circles, anti-inverse-in-incircle, 6th anti-mixtilinear, 1st anti-Sharygin, anti-tangential-midarc, anti-Ursa minor, anti-Wasat, circumorthic, Ehrmann-side, Ehrmann-vertex, 2nd Ehrmann, 2nd Euler, 1st excosine, extangents, intangents, 1st Kenmotu diagonals, 2nd Kenmotu diagonals, Kosnita, Lucas antipodal tangential, Lucas(-1) antipodal tangential, orthic, submedial, tangential, inner tri-equilateral, outer tri-equilateral, Trinh.
