<h3 id="X30351">X(30351) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-INVERSE-IN-INCIRCLE AND INNER TRI-EQUILATERAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(-2*sqrt(3)*((b+c)*a-(b-c)^2)*S+(b+c)*a^3-3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2+3*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a-(b^2+c^2)*(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11488). X(30351) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30351) lies on these lines:
{1,16}, {7,354}, {57,30300}, {65,30338}, {226,30309}, {518,30414}, {559,4336}, {999,18469}, {1210,30316}, {5045,30344}, {5902,30433}, {10980,30356}, {11018,30280}, {11019,30292}, {11031,30364}, {11032,30372}, {18398,10651}, {30350,10655}</p>
<p>
X(30351) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (354, 5572, 30352), (354, 30377, 7)<br>
