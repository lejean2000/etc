The homothetic center of these triangles is X(9817). X(30395) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30395) lies on these lines:
{1,8099}, {165,258}, {174,10980}, {1699,9795}, {3339,30420}, {5223,8125}, {5691,12581}, {7028,30393}, {7588,30389}, {7987,8082}, {7988,21623}, {7991,8092}, {8080,30326}, {8084,8089}, {8086,30308}, {8088,30315}, {8094,11531}, {8242,30337}, {8250,30363}, {8351,30343}, {8388,30330}, {8423,11033}, {8734,11407}, {9814,30405}, {9819,30423}, {11859,30291}, {11889,30304}, {11899,16189}, {18409,18421}, {18456,30392}, {30396,30418}, {30397,30419}, {10655,30421}, {10656,30422}</p>
