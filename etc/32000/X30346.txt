<h3 id="X30346">X(30346) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-INVERSE-IN-INCIRCLE AND 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*((b+c)*a^3-3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2+3*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a+(-2*(b+c)*a+2*b^2-4*b*c+2*c^2)*S-(b^2+c^2)*(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(3068). X(30346) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30346) lies on these lines:
{1,372}, {7,354}, {57,30296}, {65,30333}, {226,30306}, {518,30412}, {999,18458}, {1210,30313}, {1827,13390}, {3333,30400}, {4319,13389}, {5045,30341}, {5902,30431}, {8083,30406}, {10980,30354}, {11018,30276}, {11019,30288}, {11031,30360}, {11032,30368}, {11033,30418}, {18398,30425}, {30350,30396}</p>
<p>
X(30346) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (354, 5572, 30347), (354, 30375, 7)<br>
