The homothetic center of these triangles is X(21648). X(30383) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30383) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {4,10650}, {8,30322}, {10,30317}, {11,30378}, {515,18471}, {516,30301}, {1125,10648}, {1699,30357}, {1737,18423}, {3638,5074}, {3817,30310}, {4292,11097}, {4425,30365}, {7988,10656}, {11019,30293}, {12047,10652}, {12053,30339}, {21620,30345}, {21622,30373}, {21623,30422}, {21624,30410}, {30384,30434}</p>
<p>
X(30383) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (2, 7, 1652), (142, 226, 30382)<br>
