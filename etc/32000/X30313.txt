Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (2*(b+c)^2*S+(-a+b+c)*((b^2+4*b*c+c^2)*a-(b+c)*(b-c)^2))*(a-b+c)*(a+b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11462). X(30313) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30313) lies on these lines:
{2,30385}, {4,30296}, {5,30306}, {7,12}, {10,30380}, {11,30333}, {355,18458}, {442,30324}, {495,30341}, {1210,30346}, {1329,30412}, {1698,6203}, {3679,30319}, {5051,30360}, {5587,30400}, {7133,8230}, {7741,30431}, {7951,30425}, {7989,30354}, {8088,30418}, {8382,30406}, {8582,30288}, {8728,30276}, {17606,30375}, {18395,18410}, {30315,30396}</p>
