This preamble and centers X(31994)-X(32000) were contributed by Clark Kimberling and Peter Moses, April 15, 2019.

<p>
Suppose that P = p:q:r (barycentrics).  The <b>Point I-Caph</b> of P is the point given by
</p>
<p>
2qr + (p+q+r)p : 2rp + (p+q+r)q : 2pq + (p+q+r)r.
</p>
<p>
See sections below for Points II-Caph, III-Caph, and IV-Caph.  The points in a Caph family of a point P all lie on the line PP*, where P* is the isotomic conjugate of P.  (The name <b>Caph</b> is that of a a star, also known as Beta Cassiopeiae.)
</p>
The appearance of {i,j} in the following list means that X(j) = Point I-Caph of X(i):
