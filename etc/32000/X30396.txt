<h3 id="X30396">X(30396) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS AND SUBMEDIAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(-2*(a^2+2*(b+c)*a-3*(b-c)^2)*S+(a^2+2*(b-c)*a-(3*b+c)*(b-c))*(a^2-2*(b-c)*a+(b+3*c)*(b-c)))  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(10961). X(30396) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30396) lies on these lines:
{1,30375}, {7,1699}, {165,6203}, {1743,8941}, {3339,30425}, {30306,30308}, {30313,30315}, {30393,30412}</p>
<p>
X(30396) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (3062, 10980, 30397), (6203, 30354, 165)<br>
