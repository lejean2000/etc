Let f(a,b,c,x,y,z) = a^2 (b^2 - c^2) (-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) (y - z) y z.  The cubic mentioned just above is given by the following equation:

<p>
f(a,b,c,x,y,z) + f(b,c,a,y,z,x) + f(c,a,b,z,x,y) - 2 a^2 b^2 c^2 x y z = 0.

The following perspectivities were contributed by Peter Moses, January 5, 2019:


A'B'C' is perspective to the following triangles, with perspector X(2): orthic, submedial (see (9813)), orthic-of-anticomplementary.<br>


A'B'C' is perspective to the following triangles, with perspector X(3): medial, tangential, 1st circumperp, 2nd circumperp, outer Napoleon, inner Napoleon, outer Fermat, inner Fermat, outer Vecten, inner Vector, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, Fuhrmann, 1st Brocard, Kosnita, McCay, Trinh, Carnot, 2nd Euler, Ara, 1st Ehrmann, Ascella, Ae, Ai, infinite altitude, anti-Hutson intouch (see X11363)), anti-incircle-circles (see X(11363)),  Ehrmann side-triangle


The appearance of T,i in the following list means that A'B'C' is perspective to the triangle T, and the perspector is X(i):
