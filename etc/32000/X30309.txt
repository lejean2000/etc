<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11452). X(30309) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30309) lies on these lines:
{2,30300}, {4,10647}, {5,30316}, {7,11}, {12,30338}, {226,30351}, {496,30344}, {1653,1699}, {2886,30414}, {3817,30382}, {5886,18469}, {7741,10651}, {7951,30433}, {7988,30356}, {8086,30421}, {8226,30327}, {8227,10649}, {8229,30364}, {8379,30409}, {8727,30280}, {10863,30292}, {11522,30321}, {17605,30377}, {18393,18422}, {30308,10655}</p>
