Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (2*(b+c)*S+(-a+b+c)*((b+c)*a-(b-c)^2))*(a+c-b)*(a+b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(21640). X(30380) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30380) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {4,30400}, {8,30319}, {10,30313}, {11,30375}, {482,2362}, {515,18458}, {516,30296}, {1086,8243}, {1125,30385}, {1659,4000}, {1699,30354}, {1737,18410}, {3817,30306}, {4425,30360}, {4648,13390}, {5393,7133}, {7988,30396}, {11019,30288}, {12047,30425}, {12053,30333}, {13388,18589}, {21620,30341}, {21622,30368}, {21623,30418}, {21624,30406}, {30384,30431}</p>
