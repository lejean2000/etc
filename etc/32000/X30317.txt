The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11467). X(30317) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30317) lies on these lines:
{2,10648}, {4,30301}, {5,30310}, {7,12}, {10,30383}, {11,30339}, {355,18471}, {442,30328}, {1210,30352}, {1329,30415}, {1652,1698}, {3679,30322}, {5051,30365}, {5587,10650}, {7741,30434}, {7951,10652}, {7989,30357}, {8087,30373}, {8088,30422}, {8382,30410}, {8582,30293}, {8728,30281}, {17606,30378}, {18395,18423}, {30315,10656}</p>
