Let B' and C' be the orthogonal projections of the A-excenter of ABC on AC and AB, respectively. Then the quadrangle BCB'C' is tangential. Let (O'a) be its incircle and define (O'b) and (O'c) cyclically. Then X(31539) is the centroid of curvatures of (O'a), (O'b), and (O'c). (Randy Hutson, February 12, 2019). These circles are the companion incircles used in Elkies's construction of X(176).

X(31539) lies on these lines:

X(31539) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (1, 17803, 175), (175, 17802, 1), (17802, 17803, 481)<br>
