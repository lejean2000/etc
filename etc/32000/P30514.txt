Following TCCT (page 196), the intriangle of a point P = p: q : r (barycentrics) is the central triangle having A-vertex
</p>
<p>
A' = 0 : b (c q + b r cos A) : c (b r + c q) cos A
</p>
<p>
and the extriangle of P is the central triangle having A-vertex
</p>
<p>
A'' = -a p (c q + b r cos A)(b r + c q cos A) : a q (c q + b r cos A)(a r + c p cos B) : a p (a r + c q cos A)(a q + b p cos C)
</p>
<p>
Properties of A'B'C' and A'''B'''C'':
</p>
<p>
1.  A'B'C' is inscribed in ABC, which is inscribed in A''B''C''.
</p>
<p>
2.  The locus of P for which A'B'C' is perspective to ABC is the Darboux cubic, K004; the locus of the perspector is the Thomson cubic, K002.
</p>
<p>
3.  The locus of P for which A''B''C'' is perspective to ABC is the union of the circumcircle, the lines BC, CA, AB, the line at infinity, and the cubic K004.  If P is on the line at infinity, then the perspector is on the cubic K162.
</p>
<p>
4.  The locus of P for which A''B''C'' is perspective to the cevian triangle of P is the same as for property 3.
</p>
<p>
5.  The locus of P for which A'B'C' is perspective to the anticevian triangle of P is the union of the lines BC, CA, AB, and the cubic K004.
</p>
<p>
6.  A'B'C'and A''B''C'' are perspective with perspector X(6).
</p>
<p>
7.  The intriangle of X(2) is perspective to the circumsymmedial triangle at X(3).
</p>
<p>
8.  The intriangle of X(6) is perspective to the 1st Ehrmann triangle (see X(8537) at X(12027); to the Artzt triangle (see X(9742) at X(6776), and to the anti-Honsberger triangle at X(184).
