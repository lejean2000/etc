Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (a+b-c)*(a-b+c)*(2*sqrt(3)*(b+c)^2*S+(-a+b+c)*((b^2+4*b*c+c^2)*a-(b+c)*(b-c)^2))  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11466). X(30316) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30316) lies on these lines:
{2,10647}, {4,30300}, {5,30309}, {7,12}, {10,30382}, {11,30338}, {355,18469}, {442,30327}, {495,30344}, {1210,30351}, {1329,30414}, {1653,1698}, {3679,30321}, {5051,30364}, {5587,10649}, {7741,30433}, {7951,10651}, {7989,30356}, {8088,30421}, {8382,30409}, {8582,30292}, {8728,30280}, {17606,30377}, {18395,18422}, {30315,10655}</p>
