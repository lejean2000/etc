Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*((b+c)*a^3-3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2+3*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a-(-2*(b+c)*a+2*b^2-4*b*c+2*c^2)*S-(b^2+c^2)*(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(3069). X(30347) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30347) lies on these lines:
{1,371}, {7,354}, {57,30297}, {65,30334}, {226,30307}, {518,30413}, {999,18460}, {1210,30314}, {1659,1827}, {3333,30401}, {4319,13388}, {5045,30342}, {5728,30325}, {5902,30432}, {8083,30407}, {10980,30355}, {11018,30277}, {11019,30289}, {11031,30361}, {11032,30369}, {11033,30419}, {18398,30426}, {30350,30397}</p>
<p>
X(30347) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (354, 5572, 30346), (354, 30376, 7)<br>
