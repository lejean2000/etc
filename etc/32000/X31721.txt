Let (I) be the incircle of ABC and B', C' the orthogonal projections of I on AC, AB, respectively. Denote B", C" the points other than B',C'  where lines BB', CC' cut (I), respectively. The tangents to (I) at B" and C" cuts BC at  A<sub>b</sub> and A<sub>c</sub>, respectively. Build B<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>b</sub> cyclically. Then these six points lie on a conic with perspector X(7) and center X(31721). (César E. Lozada, March 18, 2019)

A<sub>b</sub> is the center of the circle that is the inverse-in-B-Soddy-circle of the C-Soddy-circle.  A<sub>c</sub> is the center of the circle that is the inverse-in-C-Soddy-circle of the B-Soddy-circle.  B<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>b</sub> can be constructed cyclically.
