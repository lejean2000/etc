<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(19355). X(30324) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30324) lies on these lines:
{1,1588}, {2,7}, {4,1123}, {5,8957}, {6,1659}, {12,14121}, {37,13390}, {65,7090}, {176,7586}, {281,13459}, {405,30385}, {442,30313}, {486,8953}, {950,30333}, {1490,30400}, {1750,30354}, {1864,30375}, {3069,13389}, {3085,6212}, {3487,30341}, {3586,30431}, {4000,8243}, {4199,30360}, {4295,6213}, {5728,30346}, {5927,30288}, {6351,13388}, {7580,30296}, {7593,30406}, {8079,30368}, {8080,30418}, {8226,30306}, {9612,30425}, {10910,18995}, {11523,30319}, {18397,18410}, {18446,18458}, {30326,30396}</p>
<p>
X(30324) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (2, 7, 30276), (7, 30412, 6203), (9, 226, 30325)<br>
