<h3 id="X30296">X(30296) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st ANTI-CIRCUMPERP AND 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(a^4-3*(b+c)*a^3+2*(-a+b+c)*S*a+3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2+2*(b-c)^2*b*c-(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11417). X(30283) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30296) lies on these lines:
{2,30306}, {3,30276}, {4,30313}, {7,55}, {35,30425}, {36,30431}, {40,30400}, {56,30333}, {57,30346}, {165,6203}, {484,18410}, {516,30380}, {517,18458}, {1155,30375}, {1376,30412}, {1721,6204}, {1742,5414}, {2066,9441}, {3295,30341}</p>
<p>
X(30296) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (55, 11495, 30297), (165, 30354, 6203)<br>
