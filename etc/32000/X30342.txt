Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 3*(b+c)*a^2-2*S*a-2*(b-c)^2*a-(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(3312). X(30342) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30342) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {142,3640}, {354,13390}, {495,30314}, {496,30307}, {942,30277}, {999,30386}, {1125,30413}, {3008,5588}, {3295,30297}, {3333,6204}, {3475,13388}, {4667,11371}, {4675,5604}, {5045,30347}, {5405,10980}, {8092,30407}, {8351,30419}, {11035,30289}, {11043,30361}, {11044,30369}, {11529,30320}, {17609,30376}, {18398,18411}, {21620,30381}, {30343,30397}</p>

X(30342) = midpoint of X(1) and X(1374)<br>
X(30342) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (1, 5542, 30341), (7, 30334, 30426), (4310, 11037, 30341)<br>
