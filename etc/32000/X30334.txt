<h3 id="X30334">X(30334) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-HUTSON INTOUCH AND 2nd KENMOTU DIAGONALS</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; -4*S*a+(-a+b+c)*(3*a^2+(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(1152). X(30334) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30334) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {8,14121}, {11,30314}, {12,30307}, {55,16441}, {56,30297}, {65,30347}, {144,3640}, {145,3641}, {950,30325}, {1659,10578}, {1697,6204}, {3057,6283}, {3084,17784}, {3601,30277}, {4419,5604}, {5274,5405}, {5281,5393}, {5414,30412}, {5697,18411}, {7962,30320}, {8240,30361}, {8241,30369}, {8242,30419}, {9778,13388}, {9812,13390}, {10580,13389}, {10866,30289}, {11371,17014}, {11924,30407}, {12053,30381}, {13387,14004}, {14942,30336}, {30337,30397}</p>

X(30334) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j): (8, 14121), (175, 1)<br>
X(30334) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (1, 390, 30333), (4344, 9785, 30333), (17805, 30332, 11200)<br>
