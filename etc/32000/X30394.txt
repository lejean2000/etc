Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(16*b*c*sin(A/2)+a^2+2*(b+c)*a-3*(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(9816). X(30394) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30394) lies on these lines:
{1,10502}, {165,173}, {177,30371}, {236,30393}, {1699,11891}, {5223,8126}, {5691,12582}, {7587,30389}, {7590,7987}, {7593,30326}, {7988,21624}, {7991,8351}, {8083,8090}, {8092,30343}, {8379,30308}, {8382,30315}, {8389,30330}, {8425,30363}, {8729,11407}, {9814,30404}, {9819,30411}, {11531,12445}, {11535,16189}, {11860,30291}, {11924,30337}, {18408,18421}, {18454,30392}, {30396,30406}, {30397,30407}, {10655,30409}, {10656,30410}</p>
<p>
X(30394) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (173, 8423, 165), (173, 11195, 8423)<br>
