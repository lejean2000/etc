Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (a+b-c)*(a-b+c)*(2*sqrt(3)*(b+c)*S+(-a+b+c)*((b+c)*a-(b-c)^2))  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(21647). X(30382) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30382) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {4,10649}, {8,30321}, {10,30316}, {11,30377}, {515,18469}, {516,30300}, {1125,10647}, {1699,30356}, {1737,18422}, {3639,5074}, {3817,30309}, {4292,11098}, {4425,30364}, {7988,10655}, {11019,30292}, {12047,10651}, {12053,30338}, {21620,30344}, {21622,30372}, {21623,30421}, {21624,30409}, {30384,30433}</p>
<p>
X(30382) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (2, 7, 1653), (142, 226, 30383)<br>
