<h3 id="X30333">X(30333) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-HUTSON INTOUCH AND 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 4*S*a+(-a+b+c)*(3*a^2+(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(1151). X(30333) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30333) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {8,7090}, {11,30313}, {12,30306}, {55,16440}, {56,30296}, {65,30346}, {144,3641}, {145,3640}, {950,30324}, {1659,9812}, {1697,6203}, {2066,30413}, {3057,6405}, {3083,17784}, {3601,30276}, {4419,5605}, {5274,5393}, {5281,5405}, {5697,18410}, {7962,30319}, {8240,30360}, {8241,30368}, {8242,30418}, {9778,13389}, {10578,13390}, {10580,13388}, {10866,30288}, {11370,17014}, {11924,30406}, {12053,30380}, {13386,14004}, {14942,30335}, {30337,30396}</p>
<p>
X(30333) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j): (8, 7090), (176, 1), (8986, 4297)<br>
X(30333) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (4344, 9785, 30334), (8236, 17802, 1), (17802, 30332, 11200)<br>
