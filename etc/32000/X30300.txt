<h3 id="X30300">X(30300) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st ANTI-CIRCUMPERP AND INNER TRI-EQUILATERAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(2*sqrt(3)*(-a+b+c)*S*a+a^4-3*(b+c)*a^3+3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2-(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a+2*(b-c)^2*b*c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11420). X(30300) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30300) lies on these lines:
{2,30309}, {3,30280}, {4,30316}, {7,55}, {35,10651}, {36,30433}, {40,10649}, {56,30338}, {57,30351}, {165,1653}, {484,18422}, {516,30382}, {1082,4336}, {1155,30377}, {1250,1742}, {1376,30414}, {3295,30344}, {4220,30364}, {7580,30327}, {7589,30409}, {7991,30321}, {8075,30372}, {8076,30421}, {9441,10638}, {10860,30292}</p>
<p>
X(30300) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (55, 11495, 30301), (165, 30356, 1653)<br>
