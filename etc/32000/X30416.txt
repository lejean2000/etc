Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (a*(a+b+c)+S)*((a+b-c)*c+S)*((a-b+c)*b+S)*(-a+b+c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(19430). X(30416) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30416) lies on these lines:
{7,7090}, {8,30335}, {9,30429}, {346,15892}, {518,30348}, {958,30387}, {3616,16213}, {5273,30302}, {5745,30278}</p>
