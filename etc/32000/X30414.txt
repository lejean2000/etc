Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(-a+b+c)+sqrt(3)*S  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(17826). X(30414) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30414) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {8,5240}, {10,22237}, {37,11489}, {44,11488}, {45,23303}, {145,5245}, {219,5367}, {236,30409}, {281,471}, {302,344}, {395,16777}, {518,30351}, {936,10649}, {958,10647}, {962,1277}, {997,18469}, {1125,30344}, {1329,30316}, {1376,30300}, {1698,10651}, {2886,30309}, {3241,7026}, {3616,5239}, {3617,5246}, {3639,5199}, {3679,30433}, {5692,18422}, {7028,30421}, {8580,30356}, {9761,17243}, {11790,16808}, {16645,16675}, {16885,23302}, {18227,30292}, {18235,30364}, {30393,10655}</p>
<p>
X(30414) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (9, 5242, 2), (3306, 27508, 30415), (5328, 5749, 30415)<br>
