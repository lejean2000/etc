<h3 id="X30280">X(30280) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-ASCELLA AND INNER TRI-EQUILATERAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (2*sqrt(3)*S*a-((b+c)*a-b^2+2*b*c-c^2)*(-a+b+c))*(a+b-c)*(a+c-b)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11408). X(30280) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30280) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {3,30300}, {277,2306}, {942,30344}, {3601,30338}, {8726,10649}, {8727,30309}, {8728,30316}, {8729,30409}, {8731,30364}, {8733,30372}, {8734,30421}, {10855,30292}, {10857,30356}, {11018,30351}, {11407,10655}, {11518,30321}, {15803,10651}, {17603,30377}, {18422,30274}, {18443,18469}, {30282,30433}</p>
<p>
X(30280) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (2, 7, 30327), (57, 142, 30281)<br>
