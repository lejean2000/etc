<h3 id="X30352">X(30352) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-INVERSE-IN-INCIRCLE AND OUTER TRI-EQUILATERAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a*(2*sqrt(3)*((b+c)*a-(b-c)^2)*S+(b+c)*a^3-3*(b^2+c^2)*a^2+3*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)*a-(b^2+c^2)*(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11489). X(30352) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30352) lies on these lines:
{1,15}, {7,354}, {57,30301}, {65,30339}, {226,30310}, {518,30415}, {999,18471}, {1082,4336}, {1210,30317}, {3333,10650}, {5045,30345}, {5728,30328}, {5902,30434}, {8083,30410}, {10980,30357}, {11018,30281}, {11019,30293}, {11031,30365}, {11032,30373}, {11033,30422}, {18398,10652}, {30350,10656}</p>
