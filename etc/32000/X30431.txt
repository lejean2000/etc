Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; -6*S*a+5*a^3-4*(b+c)*a^2+(b-c)^2*a-2*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(6200). X(30431) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30431) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {36,30296}, {80,7133}, {517,18410}, {3586,30324}, {3679,30412}, {5119,6203}, {5902,30346}, {7741,30313}, {7951,30306}, {9819,30396}, {30276,30282}, {30288,30294}, {30319,30323}, {30360,30366}, {30368,30374}, {30380,30384}, {30406,30411}, {30418,30423}</p>
