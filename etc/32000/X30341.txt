<h3 id="X30341">X(30341) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-INCIRCLE-CIRCLES AND 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 3*(b+c)*a^2+2*S*a-2*(b-c)^2*a-(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(3311). X(30341) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30341) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {142,3641}, {354,1659}, {495,30313}, {496,30306}, {942,30276}, {1125,30412}, {3008,5589}, {3295,30296}, {3296,7133}, {3333,6203}, {3475,13389}, {3487,30324}, {4667,11370}, {4675,5605}, {5045,30346}, {5393,10980}, {8092,30406}, {11035,30288}, {11043,30360}, {17609,30375}, {18398,18410}, {21620,30380}, {30343,30396}</p>
<p>
X(30341) = midpoint of X(1) and X(1373)<br>
X(30341) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (7, 30333, 30425), (390, 21169, 30426), (4310, 11037, 30342)<br>
