Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; -2*S*a+3*a^3-(b-c)^2*a-2*(b^2-c^2)*(b-c)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(372). X(30425) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30425) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {35,30296}, {36,30385}, {46,486}, {65,18410}, {79,7133}, {942,30375}, {1478,9907}, {1698,30412}, {1836,13388}, {3339,30396}, {3474,13390}, {7741,30306}, {7951,30313}, {9612,30324}, {11246,13389}, {12047,30380}, {13436,28849}, {15803,30276}, {18398,30346}, {25415,30319}, {30288,30290}, {30360,30362}, {30368,30370}, {30406,30408}, {30418,30420}</p>

X(30425) = reflection of X(1) in X(481)<br>
X(30425) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (390, 30342, 1), (4292, 24248, 30426), (30333, 30341, 1)<br>
