<i>Let T'=A'B'C' and T"=A"B"C" be two triangles. Then the orthopoles of the sidelines of T' with respect to T" and the orthopoles of the sidelines of T" with respect to T' lie on an ellipse having for center the midpoint of the orthocenters of T' and T". When  T' and T" are inscribed in concentric circles, the ellipse is a circle. Also, under certain conditions, the orthopoles may be coincident or collinear.</i>

<p>The ellipse just described is here named the <b>orthopolar ellipse</b> or <b>orthopolar circle</b> of T' and T".</p>
<p>This section deals with pairs of triangles inscribed in concentric circles. The appearance of (T', T", i) in the following lists means that X(i) is the center of the orthopolar circle of triangles T' and T".</p>
