<h3 id="X30338">X(30338) = ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: ANTI-HUTSON INTOUCH AND INNER TRI-EQUILATERAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 4*sqrt(3)*a*S+(-a+b+c)*(3*a^2+(b-c)^2)  :  :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11480). X(30338) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30338) lies on these lines:
{1,7}, {8,5240}, {11,30316}, {12,30309}, {55,10647}, {56,30300}, {65,30351}, {559,9778}, {950,30327}, {1082,10580}, {1653,1697}, {3057,30377}, {3601,30280}, {5697,18422}, {7962,30321}, {8240,30364}, {8241,30372}, {8242,30421}, {10866,30292}, {11924,30409}, {12053,30382}, {30337,10655}</p>
<p>
X(30338) = {X(i), X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (1, 390, 30339), (1, 3639, 11038), (4344, 4345, 30339)<br>
