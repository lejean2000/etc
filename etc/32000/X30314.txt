The homothetic center of these triangles is X(11463). X(30314) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30314) lies on these lines:
{2,30386}, {4,30297}, {5,30307}, {7,12}, {10,30381}, {11,30334}, {355,18460}, {442,30325}, {495,30342}, {1210,30347}, {1329,30413}, {1698,6204}, {3679,30320}, {5051,30361}, {5587,30401}, {7741,30432}, {7951,30426}, {7989,30355}, {8087,30369}, {8088,30419}, {8382,30407}, {8582,30289}, {8728,30277}, {17606,30376}, {18395,18411}, {30315,30397}</p>
