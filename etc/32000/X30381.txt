The homothetic center of these triangles is X(21641). X(30381) is their endo-homothetic center only when ABC is acute.</p>
<p>X(30381) lies on these lines:
{2,7}, {4,30401}, {8,30320}, {10,30314}, {11,30376}, {37,8243}, {481,16232}, {515,18460}, {516,30297}, {1125,30386}, {1659,4648}, {1699,30355}, {1737,18411}, {3817,30307}, {4000,13390}, {4425,30361}, {5405,7595}, {7988,30397}, {10858,16432}, {11019,30289}, {12047,30426}, {12053,30334}, {13389,18589}, {21620,30342}, {21622,30369}, {21623,30419}, {21624,30407}, {30384,30432}</p>
