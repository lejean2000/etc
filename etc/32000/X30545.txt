<h3 id="X30545">X(30545) = PERSPECTOR OF THESE TRIANGLES:  DUPLE-OF-ANTICEVIAN-OF-X(75) AND INTOUCH</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; b c (a - b + c) (a + b - c) (- b c + a c + a b) : :
<p>
The A-vertex of the duple-of-anticevian-triangle-of-X(75) is A'' = -b c : a b : a c.  Among its perspectivities with other triangles are these, all with perspector X(1):
</p>
<p>
ABC, media, incentral, excentral, mid-arc, 2nd midarc, 2nd circumperp, inner mixtilinears, outer mixtilinear, Andromeda, Antila, Aquilla, Caelum, innear Malfatti, outer Malfatti, inverse-of-ABC in circle, inner Yff, outer Yff, anti-Aquilla, 4th Conway, 5th Conway, inner Yff tangents, outer Yff tangents, Gemini 15.  In addition to those, Peter Moses found the following perspectivities for A''B''C'' (January 5, 2019):
</p>
<p>
intouch (TCCT 6.8): X(30545)<br>
2nd extouch (ETC X(5927)): X(30546)<br>
2nd Conway (ETC X(9776)): X(30547)<br>
Gemini 60: X(30548)<br>
