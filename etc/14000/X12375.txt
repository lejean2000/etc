Let Ka, Kb, Kc be the free vertices of the Kenmotu squares.  Triangle KaKbKc is here named the <b>1st Kenmotu free vertices triangle.</b>  KaKbKc is the anti-Kosnita triangle of the 1st Kenmotu diagonals triangle.  KaKbKc is homothetic to ABC at X(372).  X(12375) is the perspector of the 1st Kenmotu diagonals triangle and the reflection of KaKbKc in X(371).  (Randy Hutson, July 21, 2017)
