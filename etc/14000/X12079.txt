Let M<sub>a</sub>M<sub>b</sub>M<sub>c </sub> = medial triangle. Let (&Pscr;<sub>a</sub>) be the parabola, tangent to Euler line, to NM<sub>a</sub>, and to the line BC at its vertex, so that its directrix, d<sub>a</sub>, is parallel to BC. Define the lines d<sub>b</sub> and d<sub>c</sub> cyclically. Let T be the triangle bounded by the lines d<sub>a</sub>, d<sub>b</sub>, d<sub>c</sub>.  Then T is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(12079). For a construction, see Paris Pamfilos, <a href="https://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2014volume14/FG201431.pdf">A Gallery of Conics by Five Elements</a>, <i>Forum Geometricorum</i> 14 (2014) 295-348, paragraph 13.3, page 346: construct a conic tangent to the line at infinity, i.e. a parabola, tangent to three lines a, b, c and passing through [D], i.e. with given axis-direction.
