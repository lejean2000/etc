Suppose that P = p : q : r (barycentrics) is a point in the plane of a triangle ABC.  The Steiner image of P is introduced here as the point

<p>
Let S be the Steiner circumellipse of the cevian triangle A'B'C' of P.  Let A'' be the point, other than A', in which S meets line BC, and define B'' and C'' cyclically.  The lines AA'', BB'', CC'' concur in S(P).  (Contributed by Peter Moses, June 23, 2017; see also X(13486).
