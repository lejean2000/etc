Let Ka', Kb', Kc' be the free vertices of the 2nd Kenmotu squares.  Triangle Ka'Kb'Kc' is here named the <b>2nd Kenmotu free vertices triangle.</b>  Ka'Kb'Kc' is the anti-Kosnita triangle of the 2nd Kenmotu diagonals triangle.  Ka'Kb'Kc' is homothetic to ABC at X(371).  X(12376) is the perspector of the 2nd Kenmotu diagonals triangle and the reflection of Ka'Kb'Kc' in X(372). (Randy Hutson, July 21, 2017)
