This preamble and centers X(12835)-X(12841) were contributed by Peter Moses, March 29, 2017.

<p>
Let IE59 denote the inellipse with perspector X(59).  The center of IE59 is X(13006), and IE59 passes through X(i) for these i:
</p>
<p>
55, 56, 181, 202, 203, 215, 1124, 1335, 1362, 1397, 1672, 1673, 1682, 2007, 2008, 3235, 3236, 3237, 3238, 6056, 7005, 7006, 7066, 10799, 12835, 12836, 12837, 12838, 12839, 12840, 12841
</p>
<p>
This ellipse IE59 is the locus of the centers of similtude (insimilicenter and exsimilicenter) of the incircle with Tucker circles.  Also, IE59 intersects the incircle in X(1362) and three other points, so that the corresponding four Tucker circles are tangent to the incircle.  The Tucker circle through X(1362) has the following parameter:
</p>
<p>
arccos[(t<sup>2</sup> - s<sup>2</sup>)/(t<sup>2</sup> + s<sup>2</sup>)], where t = r + 4R.
</p>
<p>
The centers of the other three Tucker circles are the extraversions of X(970), and they lie on the Brocard axis.  Not only are these circle internally tangent to the incircle, but they are also externally tangent to the two corresponding excircles.  In this section, the names for centers X(12835) to X(12841), the notation "Tucker (X,p)-circle" represents the Tucker circle with center X and parameter p.
</p>
<p>
Let f(a,b,c,x,y,z) = b<sup>4</sup>c<sup>4</sup>(a - b - c)<sup>2</sup>(b - c)<sup>4</sup>x<sup>2</sup> - 2a<sup>4</sup>b<sup>2</sup>c<sup>2</sup>(a - b)<sup>2</sup>
(a - b + c)(c - a)<sup>2</sup>(a + b - c)yz. The ellipse IE59 is given by the barycentric equation f(a,b,c,x,y,z) + f(b,c,a,y,z,x) + f(c,a,b,z,x,y) = 0.
</p>
<p>
Possibly the earliest mention of IE59 occurs in TCCT, page 238, in a list of inscribed ellipses; in that list, this ellipse is denoted by W(X<sub>11</sub>).
