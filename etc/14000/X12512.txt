The reciprocal orthologic center of these triangles is X(1).

<p>
As a point P moves on the circumcircle, the centroid of the 12 excenters of triangles ABC, BCP, CAP, ABP traces a curvilinear triangle, T.  Let A', B', C' be the vertices of T, and (Oa), (Ob), (Oc) the circles whose arcs form the sides of T; the  triangle A'B'C' is also the orthic triangle of the anticomplementary triangle of OaObOc, and OaObOc the medial triangle of the excentral triangle of A'B'C'.  Then A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle at X(12512).  Let  A" be the intersection, other than A', of circles (Ob) and (Oc), and define B" and C" cyclically.  Then A"B"C" is the excentral triangle of A'B'C', and the anticomplementary triangle of OaObOc.  Also, A"B"C" is homothetic to the extraversion triangle of X(10) (i.e. the complement of the excentral triangle) at X(12512).  (Randy Hutson, July 21, 2017)
