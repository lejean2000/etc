<i>Theorem: If any conic C be inscribed in a given triangle and a
confocal to it pass through the circumcenter, then the</i> <b>Aiyar-circle-of-C</b><i> through the intersections of these two confocals  touches the nine-points circle of the triangle</i>.

<br>
Notes: The touchpoint of the nine-points circle and the Aiyar-circle-of-the-Steiner inellipse is X(1313). For the Brocard inellipse and the McBeath inconic, the confocal conics through X(3) are degenerated.<br>
