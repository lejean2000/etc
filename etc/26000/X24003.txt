Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (a^2 + b c) (b + c) - 4 a b c : :
<p>
The inellipse that is the trilinear square of the Nagel line passes through X(1), X(75), X(341), X(872), X(1089) and X(4738).  The Brianchon point (perspector) of this inellipse is X(7035).  The vertex conjugate of the foci of this inellipse is X(765),
</p>
<p>
X(24003) lies on these lines: {1, 1120}, {2, 38}, {10, 11}, {120, 124}, {900, 3035}, {3740, 3741} et al
</p>
<p>
X(24003) = isotomic conjugate of X(32016)<br>
X(24003) = midpoint of X(1) and X(4738)<br>
X(24003) = complement of X(244)<br>
X(24003) = perspector of mid- and side-triangles of Gemini triangles 15 and 16<br>
