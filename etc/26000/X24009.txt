<h3 id="X24009">X(24009) = CENTER OF TRILINEAR SQUARE OF SODDY LINE</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; b (c - a)^2 (c + a - b)^4 + c (a - b)^2 (a + b - c)^4 : :
<p>
The inellipse that is the trilinear square of the Soddy line passes through X(1), X(1088), X(1097) and X(24014).  This inellipse is tangent to the Soddy line at X(1).
</p>
<p>
X(24009) lies on these lines: {1, 85}, {2, 24010}, {4904, 11019}
</p>
<p>
X(24009) = midpoint of X(1) and X(24014)<br>
X(24009) = complement of X(24010)<br>
