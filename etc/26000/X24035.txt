Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (2 a^4 - a^3 (b + c) - a^2 (b - c)^2 + a (b - c)^2 (b + c) - (b^2 - c^2)^2)/(a (b - c) (b + c - a) (b^2 + c^2 - a^2)) : :
<p>
Line X(515)X(24034) is the tangent to the inellipse that is the trilinear square of line X(1)X(4), at X(24030) (the trilinear square of X(515)).
</p>
<p>
Let P1 and P2 be as at X(23987).  X(24035) is the trilinear product P1*P2.
</p>
<p>
X(24035) lies on these lines: {2, 92}, {108, 9056}, {653, 1020}, {664, 6335}

X(24035) = trilinear product X(515)*X(653)<br>
X(24035) = trilinear pole of line X(515)X(24034)<br>
X(24035) = crossdifference of every pair of points on line X(1946)X(2638)<br>
