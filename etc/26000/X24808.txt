Let P be a point on the Steiner circumellipse.  Let A' be the orthocenter of BCP, and define B' and C' cyclically.  Let Q be the centroid of A'B'C'.  The locus of Q as P varies is an ellipse similar and orthogonal to the Steiner circumellipse, and also centered at X(2).  When P = X(190), Q = X(24808).  See also X(98) and X(6054).
