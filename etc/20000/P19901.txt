Let T<sub>1</sub>=A<sub>1</sub>B<sub>1</sub>C<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>=A<sub>2</sub>B<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> be two triangles not inscribed in the same circle and such that the perpendicular bisectors of A<sub>1</sub>A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>B<sub>2</sub> and C<sub>1</sub>C<sub>2</sub> concur at a point O. The point O provides a common center for handling T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> in polar coordinates. In such cases, triangles T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are called <b>polar co-centric</b> and the point O is here named the <b>polar co-center</b> of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, n) in the following list means that triangles T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are polar co-centric with X(n) as polar co-center (Note: n=0 indiates a not-yet calculated center):
