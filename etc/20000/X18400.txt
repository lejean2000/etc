The X(3)-Ehrmann triangle is the medial triangle of the tangential triangle, and also the cross-triangle of the following pairs of triangles: {1st and 2nd Kenmotu diagonals}, {inner and outer tri-equilateral}, {1st and 2nd anti-Conway}.  It is also the anti-inner-Conway triangle and the reflection of the Kosnita triangle in X(10282).  See X(25) for a generalization.
