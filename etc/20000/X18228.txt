X(18228) is the homothetic center of the complement of the intouch triangle and the anticomplement of the excentral triangle. (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p>
<p>
Let A'B'C' be as defined at X(5658).  A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle and the orthic-of-intouch triangle at X(226), and to the anticomplementary triangle at X(18228). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
</p>
<p>
Let A"B"C" be the Hutson-extouch triangle.  Let La be the tangent to the A-excircle at A", and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A* = Lb&cap;Lc, B* = Lc&cap;La, C* = La&cap;Lb.  Then A*B*C* is homothetic to ABC and the orthic-of-intouch triangle at X(57), to the anticomplementary triangle at X(144), and to the medial triangle at X(18228). (Randy Hutson, June 27, 2018)
