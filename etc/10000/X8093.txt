<h3 id="X8093">X(8093)&nbsp;=&nbsp;  ORTHOLOGIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st TANGENTIAL-MIDARC TO EXCENTRAL</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; (b+c)*sin(A/2)-b*sin(B/2)-c*sin(C/2)+s : :
<p>
X(8093) is also the orthologic center from the 1st tangential midarc triangle to every triangle homothetic to the excentral triangle.
</p>
<p>
X(8093) lies on these lines:
(1, 164), (8, 177), (10, 8087), (40,8075) , (65, 2089), (72, 8079), (188, 960), (515, 8095), (517, 8091), (946, 8085), (2800, 8103), (2802, 8097), (7991, 8089), (8084, 8092)
</p>
<p>
X(8093) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j):  (8091,8099), (8094,1)<br>
X(8093) = orthocenter of 1st tangential midarc triangle<br>
X(8093) = X(155)-of-mid-arc-triangle<br>
X(8093) = radical center of circles centered at the excenters and internally tangent to the incircle<br>
X(8093) = radical center of circles centered at the vertices of the 2nd circumperp triangle and internally tangent to the incircle
