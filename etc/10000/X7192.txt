<p>
X(7192) is the perspector, with respect to the extraversion triangle of X(8), of the conic through X(4), X(8), and the extraversions of X(8).  This conic is a rectangular hyperbola centered at X(3448).  (Randy Hutson, April 11, 2015)

Let A<sub>17</sub>B<sub>17</sub>C<sub>17</sub> and A<sub>18</sub>B<sub>18</sub>C<sub>18</sub> be the Gemini triangles 17 and 18, resp.  Let E<sub>17</sub> and E<sub>18</sub> be the {ABC, Gemini 17}-circumconic and {ABC, Gemini 18}-circumconic, resp.  Let A' be the intersection of the tangent to E<sub>17</sub> at A<sub>17</sub> and the tangent to E<sub>18</sub> at A<sub>18</sub>.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC" concur in X(7192).  (Randy Hutson, November 30, 2018)
