Let A'B'C' be the hexyl triangle. Let A" be the trilinear pole of line B'C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(63).  Let A* be the trilinear pole of line B"C", and define B* and C* cyclically.  The lines AA*, BB*, CC* concur in X(8822).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)
