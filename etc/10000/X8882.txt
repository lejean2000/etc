Let P1 and P2 be the two points on the circumcircle whose Steiner lines are tangent to the circumcircle.  Let Q1 and Q2 be the respective points of tangency.  Q1 and Q2 are also the circumcircle intercepts of line X(186)X(523).  X(8882) is the barycentric product of Q1 and Q2.  See also X(2190).  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)
