Let I be the incenter of triangle ABC.  Let L<sub>B</sub> be the line through I perpendiculat to AC, and let
A<sub>B</sub> = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;BC and B<sub>A</sub> = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;BA.  Define B<sub>C</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> cyclically, and define C<sub>B</sub> and A<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let
A' be the circumcenter of IA<sub>B</sub>A<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is perspective to ABC, and the perspector is X(7100).  (Angel Montesdeoca, June 11, 2016)
