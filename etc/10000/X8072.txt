Suppose that (U,u) and (V,v) are circles.  Let (U,t*u) be the dilation from U of (U,u) by factor t, and likewise for (V,t*v).  For t in some interval, the circles (U,t*u) and (V,t*v) meet in 1 or 2 points.  The locus of the points of intersection is the <b>similitude circle</b> (or circle of similitude) of (U,u) and (V,v), denoted here by (W,w).  Let V' = dilation of V from U by factor v/(u + v), and let U' = dilation of U from V by factor u/(u - v).  Then (W,w) is the circle with diameter U'V', and V' = {U,V}-harmonic conjugate of U'.  For many choices of 3 circles, each pair gives a similitude circle and the three similitude circles meet in two points.  If they have barycentrics of the form P(a,b,c) + Q(a,b,c)*R(a,b,c) : : and P(a,b,c) - Q(a,b,c)*R(a,b,c) : : , where P and Q are polynomials with positive leading coefficients when regarded as polynomials in a, and R has a power series expansion in a such that the coefficient of the first nonzero term is positive, then the first of these is here introduced as the <b>1st harmonic trace</b> of the 3 circles, and the second, as the <b>2nd harmonic trace.</b>, then the first of these is here introduced as the <b>1st harmonic trace</b> of the 3 circles, and the second, as the <b>2nd harmonic trace.</b>  (Clark Kimberling, August 7, 2015; revised, November 27, 2016)

Suppose (A',u}, (B',v), (C',w) are circles in the plane of a triangle ABC.  It appears that for an arbitary triangle center X of an acute triangle ABC, the following choices of (A',f}, (B',g), (C',h) yield harmonic traces:
</p>
<p>
f = |AA'|, g = |BB'|, h = |CC'|, where A'B'C' = cevian triangle of X<br>
f = |A'X|, g = |B'X|, h = |C'X|, where A'B'C' = cevian triangle of X<br>
f = |A'X|, g = |B'X|, h = |C'X|, where A'B'C' = pedal triangle of X<br>
f = |AA'|, g = |BB'|, h = |CC'|, where A'B'C' = anticevian triangle of X

The centers of the three intersecting similitude circles lie on the radical axis of the circumcircle of the centers of the original circles and their radical circle.  The circles are coaxal, with common radical trace = radical trace of the circumcircle of the centers of the original circles and their radical circle. (Randy Hutson, August 15, 2015)

Soon after the appearance of X(8072) in ETC, Randy Hutson introduced the name <b>harmonic center</b> for the center W of the similitude circle of (U,u) and (V,v), and found examples shown in the table below.
</p>
<p>
A combo for harmonic centers is given by W = v<sup>2</sup>U - u<sup>2</sup>V, and W is the midpoint of the insimilicenter(U,V) and exsimilicenter(U,V).  (Randy Hutson, January 17, 2016)

The center of the A-similitude circle (i.e., the similitude circle of the B- and C- excircles) has barycentrics b-c : b : c; also,<br>
(radius squared) =  bc(c + a - b)(a + b - c)/(4(b - c)<sup>2</sup><br>
(power of A wrt A-similude circle) = 0<br>
(power of B wrt A-similude circle) = c(-a^2+b^2-c^2))/(2(b-c))<br>
(power of C wrt A-similude circle) = b(a^2+b^2-c^2))/(2 (b-c))<br>
The A-, B-, C- similitude circles concur in two points:  X(8072) and X(8073).
For a related triple of circles, see X(11065).  (Peter Moses, November 30, 2016)
