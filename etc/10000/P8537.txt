In <a href="http://www.hyacinthos.epizy.com/message.php?msg=6098">Hyacinthos #6098</a>), December 2, 2002, Jean-Pierre Ehrmann defines a circle as follows.  Let P be a point in the plane of ABC and not on the lines BC, CA, AB.  Let A<sub>B</sub> the the point of intersection of the circle {{P,B,C}} and the line AB.  Define A<sub>C</sub> symmetrically, and define B<sub>C</sub>, B<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>B</sub> cyclically.  These six points of intersection are on a circle if and only if P = X(6).  This circle is here named the <b>Ehrmann circle</b>.  The circles {{X(6),B,C}}, {{X(6),C,A}}, {{X(6),A,B,}} are the <b>A-Ehrmann circle, B-Ehrmann circle, C-Ehrmann circle</b>, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The center of the Ehrmann circle is X(576) and the radius, sqrt(1+9*tan(&omega;)^2)*(R/2).  No ETC-center X(i) lies on this circle, for 1 &lt;= i &lt;= 8550.
</p>
<p>
Let A' be the center of the A-Ehrmann circle, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is here named the <b>1st Ehrmann triangle</b>.  Trilinears are given by
</p>
<p>
A'= -(a^4-b^4+4*b^2*c^2-c^4)*a : (a^2*(a^2+5*c^2)-(b^2-c^2)*(b^2-2*c^2))*b : (a^2*(a^2+5*b^2)-(c^2-b^2)*(c^2-2*b^2))*c.
</p>
<p>
The 1st Ehrmann triangle is similar to the circummedial triangle with similitude center X(23). (Randy Hutson, December 2, 2017)
</p>
<p>
Let A'' = B<sub>C</sub>B<sub>A</sub>&cap;C<sub>A</sub>C<sub>B</sub>, and define B'' and C'' cyclically.  The triangle A''B''C'' is here named the <b>2nd Ehrmann triangle</b>.  Trilinears are given by
</p>
<p>
A"= a*(a^2-2*b^2-2*c^2)/(2*a^2-b^2-c^2) : b : c
</p>
<p>
A'B'C' is perspective at X(3) to the following triangles: Ara, 1st Brocard, 1st and 2nd circumperp, 2nd Euler, Fuhrmann, Johnson, McCay, medial, inner Napoleon, outer Napoleon, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, tangential, Trinh, inner Vecten, and outer Vecten. A'B'C' is perspective to the circumsymmedial triangle at X(1296) and to the 4th Brocard triangle at X(10870).
</p>
<p>
A''B''C'' is perspective at X(6) to the following: ABC, 2nd Brocard, circumsymmedial, inner Grebe, outer Grebe, symmedial, and tangential. A''B''C'' is homothetic to the following triangles: circumorthic at X(8537), 2nd Euler at X(8538), extangents at X(8539), intangents at X(8540), orthic triangle at X(8541), and Trinh at X(511). A''B''C'' is perspective to the medial triangle at X(8542).
</p>
<p>
A'B'C' and A''B''C'' are are orthologic with centers X(6) and X(576).
</p>
<p>
Following are notes about triangles mentioned above.  The center of the Ehrmann circle is X(576).  Also, the Ehrmann circle is the incircle of the 2nd Ehrmann triangle if ABC is acute.  Otherwise it is an excircle of the 2nd Ehrmann triangle.  The 2nd Ehrmann triangle is congruent to the Trinh triangle, and also is the reflection of the Kosnita triangle in X(575).
