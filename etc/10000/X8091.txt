<h3 id="X8091">X(8091)&nbsp;=&nbsp; ORTHOLOGIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st TANGENTIAL-MIDARC TO ABC</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; -(s-a)*a*b*c*sin(A/2)+(s-b)*SC*c*sin(B/2)+(s-c)*SB*b*sin(C/2)-S^2/2 : :
<p>
X(8091) is also the orthologic center from the 1st tangential midarc triangle to every triangle homothetic to ABC.
</p>
<p>
X(8091) lies on these lines:
(1, 167), (3, 8075), (4, 5934), (5, 8085), (10, 188), (40, 8078), (259, 7593), (517, 8093), (952, 8097), (6001, 8095), (8084, 8100)
</p>
<p>
X(8091) = midpoint of X(8097) and X(8103)<br>
X(8091) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j):  (8084,8100), (8092,1), (8093,8099)<br>
X(8091) = radical center of circles centered at A, B, C, and externally tangent to the incircle
