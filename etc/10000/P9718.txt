The Dou circle is defined in MathWorld as the circle cutting the sidelines of the reference triangle ABC at A', A", B', B", C', C" so that angle(A'AA") = angle(B'BB") = angle(C'CC") = 90º. The center of the Dou circle is X(155).
<p>
Let f(a,b,c) = (a^2)[SA*(2*R^2-SA) and g(a,b,c) = bc(S^2+SB*SC-2*(SB+SC)*R^2).  A trilinear equation for the Dou circle is then
</p>
<p>
f(a,b,c)x^2 + f(b,c,a)y^2 + f(c,a,b)z^2 + g(a,b,c)yz + g(b,c,a)zx + g(c,a,b)xy = 0,

and the radius-squared is (4*R^6-S^2*(5*R^2-SW))/(4*R^2-SW)^2.

<p>
Let S = {circumcircle, nine-points-circle, orthocentroidal circle, orthoptic circle of the Steiner inellipse, polar circle (for obtuse ABC), tangential circle, Taylor circle}, and suppose that U and V are in S.  The radical circle of {U, V, Dou circle} is here named the Dow radical circle of U and V, denoted by Dou(U,V).  The center of Dou(U,V) is X(2501), and the radius-squared of Dou(U,V) is the power of X(2501) with repect to U and V.  Moreover, Dou(U,V) is orthogonal to the Dou circle and every circle in S.  The Stevanovic circle is orthogonal to the Apollonius circle, Bevan circle, excircles-radical circle, as well as every circle in S except the Taylor circle.  The radical axis of the Stevanovic and each Dou-radical circle is the Euler line, and their radical trace is X(468).  If ABC is acute then Dou(U,V) passes through X(5000) and X(5001).
