Let A'B'C' be the reflection of ABC in X(3) (ie, the circumcevian triangle of X(3)).           Let A" be the reflection of A' in line BC, and define B" and C" cyclically.  (A"B"C" is the X(3)-Fuhrmann triangle.)  Let A* be the reflection of A in B'C', and define B* and C* cyclically.  Triangle A*B*C* is inversely similar to ABC, with similitude center X(265), and A*B*C* is perspective to ABC at X(74).  A*B*C* is congruent to A''B''C'' and also  homothetic to A"B"C", with center of homothety X(7723).  Also, X(7723) = X(2072)-of-A"B"C" = X(2072)-of-A*B*C*.  (Randy Hutson, June 19, 2015)

X(7723) is the radical center of the nine-point circles of the adjunct anti-altimedial triangles. (Randy Hutson, November 2, 2017)

X(7723) lies on these lines:
{2,7722}, {3,74}, {5,1986}, {52,7687}, {68,265}, {113,1209}, {125,1568}, {185,6699}, {381,1112}, {974,5654}, {1026,7727}, {1352,2781}, {3830,6403}, {5891,5972}, {5946,7699}
<p></p>
X(7723) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j):  (52,7687), (113,5907), (185,6699), (1987,5)<br>
X(7723) = complement of X(7722)<br>
X(7723) = anticomplement of X(14708)<br>
