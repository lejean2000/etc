Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (S^2+(2*R^2+SA)*S+SA^2)*a^2 : :
<p>
Let La be the line tangent to the A-Lucas circle at the antipode of A.  Define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let Ta = Lb&cap;Lc, and define Tb and Tc cyclically.  The triangle TaTbTc is homothetic to the tangential triangle, and homothetic center is X(8939).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)

X(8939) lies on the Stammler hyperbola, the cubic K424a and these lines: {2,6503}, {3,485}, {6,493}, {155,371}, {159,3155}, {195,3311}, {399,6221}, {1151,1498}, {1584,8253}, {1599,1609}, {2164,7347}, {2178,6204}, {6219,8904}</p>
