This preamble and centers X(7581)-X(7586) were contributed by CÃ©sar Eliud Lozada, April 22-27, 2015.

Suppose that U and V are a pair of homothetic triangles.  There is a well-known point, X, called the homothetic center of U and V.  For example, the homothetic center of the 1st circumperp and 2nd extouch triangles is X = X(7580).  Now, we can "view" X from ABC as X(7580), or we can "view" X from U, in which case X is X(1993)-of-U, and by homothety, X is also X(1993)-of-V.  In general, if X = X'-of-U (or equivalently, X = X'-of-V), then the point X' (as a function of the reference triangle ABC) is introduced here as the <b>endo-homothetic center of U and V</b>.

<p>
Following are examples using pairs of homothetic triangles (all homothethic to ABC):
<br>
{U, V} = {anticomplementary, Euler}; X = X(3091), X' = X(631)
<br>
{U, V} = {anticomplementary, Johnson}; X = X(4), X' = X(3)
<br>
{U, V} = {anticomplementary, medial}; X = X(4), X' = X(2)
<br>
{U, V} = {Euler, Johnson}; X = X(381), X' = X(2)
<br>
{U, V} = {Euler, medial}; X = X(5), X' = X(3)
<br>
{U, V} = {Johnson, medial}; X = X(5), X' = X(3)
<br>
{U, V} = {outer Grebe, inner Grebe}; X = X(6), X' = X(6)
<br>
{U, V} = {outer Grebe, anticomplementary}; X = X(1270), X' = X(3068)
