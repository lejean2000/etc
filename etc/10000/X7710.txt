X(7710) is the center of the circumconic described by Francisco Javier Garcia Capitan (<a href="http://www.hyacinthos.epizy.com/message.php?msg=21466">Hyacinthos 21466</a>, January 30, 2013), in response to a problem by Antreas P. Hatzipolakis,

Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(1), let A"B"C" be the medial triangle, let A*B*C* be the circumcevian triangle of X(2) with respect to A"B"C", and let DEF be the triangle bounded by the perpendiculars to lines A"A*, B"B*, C"C* at A*,B*,C*, respectively.  The lines A"D, B"E, C"F concur in X(7710).  See <a href="http://www.hyacinthos.epizy.com/message.php?msg=21665">Hyacinthos 21665</a> (A. Hatzipolakis and R. Hutson, March 5, 2013)

Another construction for DEF follows:  Let P<sub>A</sub> be the parabola with focus A and directrix BC.  Let L<sub>A</sub> be the polar of X(3) with respect to P<sub>A</sub>.  Define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Then D = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, E = L<sub>C</sub>&cap;L<sub>A</sub>, F = L<sub>A</sub>&cap;L<sub>B</sub>.   Note that the lines AD, BE, CF concur in X(262).  (Randy Hutson, June 15, 2015)

X(7710)-of-1st-Brocard-triangle = X(7710)-of-Euler-triangle = X(7694)-of-ABC.  The term "similarity image" is defined in the preamble to X(6724).  The term "endo-similarity image" is introduced here to match "endo-homothetic" defined in the preamble to X(7581); the term "similarity image" is defined in the preamble to X(6724).

If U and V are similar triangles with similitude center S, then the endo-similarity center of U and V is the U-to-ABC functional image of S (which is also the V-to-ABC functional image of S).  (Randy Hutson, June 11, 2015)
