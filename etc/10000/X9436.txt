Let La be the line through A parallel to the Gergonne line, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let Ma be the reflection of BC in La, and define Mb and Mc cyclically.  Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to ABC, with ratio 3.  Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Gergonne line.  The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, and its centroid is X(9436); see Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008.  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)
