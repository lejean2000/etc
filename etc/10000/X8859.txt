Let Ab and Ac be the intersections of CA and AB, respectively, with the parallel to BC through X(2).  Define Bc and Ca cyclically, and define Ba and Cb cyclically.  The points          Ab, Ac, Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb lie on an ellipse, E, centered at X(2).  X(8859) = inverse-in-E of X(6).  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)

Let P* and U* be as described at X(8588).  Then X(8859) = crossdifference of P* and U*.  (Randy Hutson, December 26, 2015)
