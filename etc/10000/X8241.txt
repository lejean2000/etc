<p>X(8241) lies on these lines:
{1,167}, {8,188}, {11,8087}, {12,8085}, {55,8077}, {56,8075}, {236,259}, {950,8079}, {1317,8103}, {1697,8078}, {3057,8093}, {7962,8101}, {8239,8247}, {8240,8249}

Let (Oa) be the circle tangent to the incircle and sides CA and AB, such that its center Oa lies between A and X(1).  Define (Ob) and (Oc) cyclically.  Then X(8241) is the radical center of (Oa), (Ob), (Oc).  (Randy Hutson, October 27, 2015)

X(8241) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j):  (8,2090), (174,1)<br>
X(8241) = {X(1),X(8422)}-harmonic conjugate of X(8242)
