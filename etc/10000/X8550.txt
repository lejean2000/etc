X(8550) = X(4) - 3X(6)

<p>
The reciprocal orthologic center of the 2nd Ehrmann and MacBeath triangles is X(4).

Let P be a point on the circumcircle. Let A' be the orthogonal projection of P on the A-altitude, and define B' and C' cyclically. As P traces the circumcircle, the locus of the symmedian point of A'B'C' is an ellipse with center X(8550); see X(5884).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let T be the triangle whose vertices are the orthocenters of the altimedial triangles; then X(8550) = X(6)-of-T.  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let T' be the triangle whose vertices are the symmedian points of the altimedial triangles; then X(8550) = orthocenter of T'; see X(5884).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)
