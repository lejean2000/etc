<p>
Let A' be the isogonal conjugate of A with respect ot the incentral triangle, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is perspective to the incentral triangle at X(3746) and to the intouch triangle at X(7269).   (Randy Hutson, April 11, 2015)

X(7269) lies on these lines: {1,7}, {69,4861}, {75,4511}, {241,3723}, {273,6198}, {651,1100}, {934,5049}, {936,5936}, {1014,1319}, {1429,2171}, {1441,4360}, {1445,3247}, {1447,3920}, {1804,3304}, {1963,4565}, {3553,5222}, {3870,4460}, {5226,5256}, {5287,5435}
