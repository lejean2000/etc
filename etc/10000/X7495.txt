As a point on the Euler line, X(7495) has Shinagawa coefficients (-3 (E + 2 F), 2 S<sub>&omega;</sub>).

Let L<sub>A</sub> be the tangent at A to the A-Yiu circle, and define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is here named the <b>Yiu tangents triangle</b>.  A'B'C' is homothetic to the polar triangle of the nine-point circle at X(427), and to the orthoanticevian triangle of X(2) at X(7495).  (Randy Hutson, August 19, 2019)

A'B'C' is also the antipedal triangle of X(5).  (Randy Hutson, January 17, 2020)
