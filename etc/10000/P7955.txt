CÃ©sar Lozada (July 6, 2015) introduces the 2nd-to-6th mixtilinear triangles and contributes associated triangle centers.   Notation:
</p>
<p>
{a'} = A-mixtilinear-incircle, with center I'a; {a''} = A-mixtilinear-excircle, with center I''a<br>
A'c = {a'}&cap; AB; A'b = {a'}&cap; AC; A"c = {a''}&cap; AB; A"b = {a''}&cap; AC<br>
A'b+ = the closer to B of the 2 points in {a'}&cap;BC; A'c+ = the other point in {a'}&cap;BC.<br>
The following objects are defined cyclically:  {b'}, {c'}; {b''}, {c''}; B'a, C'b; B''a, B''c; C'b, A'c; C''b, C''a; B'c+, C'a+; B'a+, C'b+ .
</p>
<p>
<b>Theorems:</b><br>
1) Points A'b, A'c, B'c, B'a, C'a, C'b lie on an conic with center X(1).<br>
2) Points A"b, A"c, B"c, B"a, C"a,C"b lie on a conic with center X(7955).<br>
3) Points A'b+, A'c+, B'c+, B'a+, C'a+, C'b+ lie on a conic with center X(221).<br>
4) Lines (A'b-A'c), (B'c-B'a), (C'a-C'b) concur in X(1).

<b>Definitions of triangles (all coordinates are trilinears):</b>
</p>
<p>
