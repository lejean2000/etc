X(8290) is the center of hyperbola H = {{A,B,C,PU(1)}}, which is the isogonal conjugate of line PU(1), which is the line X(39)X(512)).  Also, H is the isotomic conjugate of line PU(11), which is the line X(141)X(523).  Also, H passes through X(83), X(99) and X(880).  (Randy Hutson, October 27, 2015
