Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; x - 2 y - 2 z : :, where x : y : z = X(8010)  (CÃ©sar Lozada, June 27, 2019)

X(8011) is the antipode of X(8010) in the inner Napoleon circle.

Let A'B'C' be the 1st Morley triangle.  Let Ma be the line through A parallel to B'C', and define Mb, Mc cyclically.           Let A" = Mb&cap;Mc, B" = Mc&cap;Ma, C" = Ma&cap;Mb.  Then X(8011) is the center of (equilateral) triangle A"B"C".  Also, A"B"C" is homothetic to A'B'C' at X(8065).  (Randy Hutson, August 12, 2015)

Let OaObOc be the Stammler triangle.  Let A* be the orthogonal projection of Oa on line BC, and define B* and C* cyclically.  X(8011) = X(2)-of-A*B*C*.  (Randy Hutson, August 12, 2015)
</p>
<p>
X(8011) lies on the inner Napoleon circle and these lines:  {2,8010}, {356,8065}
</p>
<p>
X(8011) = reflection of X(8010) in X(2)<br>
X(8011) = anticomplement of X(33492)<br>
