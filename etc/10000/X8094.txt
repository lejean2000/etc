<h3 id="X8094">X(8094)&nbsp;=&nbsp;  ORTHOLOGIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES: 2nd TANGENTIAL-MIDARC TO EXCENTRAL</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; (b+c)*sin(A/2)-b*sin(B/2)-c*sin(C/2)-s : :
<p>
X(8094) is also the orthologic center from the 2nd tangential midarc triangle to every triangle homothetic to the excentral triangle.
</p>
<p>
X(8094) lies on these lines:
(1, 164), (10, 8088), (40, 8076), (57, 7587), (65, 174), (72, 8080), (173, 3339), (236, 3812), (259, 1046), (515, 8096), (517, 8092), (942, 8083), (946, 8086), (960, 7028), (2800, 8104), (2802, 8098), (7991, 8090)
</p>
<p>
X(8094) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j):  (8092,8100), (8093,1)<br>
X(8094) = orthocenter of 2nd tangential midarc triangle<br>
X(8094) = radical center of circles centered at the excenters and externally tangent to the incircle<br>
X(8094) = radical center of circles centered at the vertices of the 2nd circumperp triangle and externally tangent to the incircle
