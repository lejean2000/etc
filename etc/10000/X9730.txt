Let A'B'C' be the orthocentroidal triangle of ABC and let B<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> be the orthogonal projections of B' and C' on BC, respectively. Build A<sub>B</sub>, C<sub>B</sub>, A<sub>C</sub> and B<sub>C</sub> similarly. These last six points lie on a circle with center X(9730) and radius-squared ((r^2+4*R*r+6*R^2)^2+s^4-2*(6*R^2-r^2+4*R*r)*s^2)/(36*R^2). CÃ©sar Lozada, March 17, 2016.  The circle is here named the <b>2nd Lozada circle.</b>

Let P be a point on the circumcircle.  Let Pa be the orthogonal projection of P on the A-altitude, and define Pb and Pc cyclically.  The locus of the centroid of PaPbPc as P varies is an ellipse centered at X(9730).  See also X(185).  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)

Let Ga, Gb, Gc be the centroids of the A-, B-, and C-altimedial triangles.  Then X(9730) is the orthocenter of GaGbGc.  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)

Let Ha, Hb, Hc be the orthocenters of the A-, B-, and C-altimedial triangles.  Then X(9730) is the centroid of HaHbHc.  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)
