This preamble and centers X(9776)-X(9812) were contributed by CÃ©sar Eliud Lozada, April 2, 2016.
</p>
<p>
Let ABC be a a triangle with opposite sidelengths a,b,c, respectively. Let A<sub>B</sub> be the point P on line AB such that |BP| = b and B lies between A and P.  Define B<sub>C</sub> and C<sub>A</sub> cyclically.  Likewise, let A<sub>C</sub> be the point Q on line AC such that |CP| = c and C lies between A and P.  Define B<sub>A</sub> and C<sub>B</sub> cyclically.  It is known that these six points lie on the Conway circle, with center X(1) and radius-squared r<sup>2</sup> + s<sup>2</sup>, where r = inradius and s = semiperimeter of ABC.
</p>
<p>
Let A' = B<sub>A</sub>B<sub>C</sub>&cap;C<sub>A</sub>C<sub>B</sub>, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is here named the <b>2nd Conway triangle</b> of ABC.  Let A''B''C'' be the (1st) Conway triangle, introduced at X(7411), and let A*B*C* be the intouch triangle; A' = reflection of A'' in A*, and likewise for B' and C', as noted by Peter Moses, April 2, 2016.
</p>
<p>
area(A'B'C') = 8Rs<br>
|B'C'| = sqrt(8*S*R*a/((s-b)*(s-c)))<br>
A' = - (a + b + c) : a + b - c : a - b + c (barycentric coordinates)
</p>
<p>
The vertices A', B', C' lie on these cubics: K007 (Lucas cubic), K028, K461, K651.
</p>
<p>
Another construction of A<sub>B</sub> and A<sub>C</sub> follows.  Let p<sub>a</sub> be the parabola tangent to BC at the A-cevian-trace-of-X(75) and also tangent to the sidelines AB and AC. A<sub>B</sub> and A<sub>C</sub> are the touchpoints of p<sub>a</sub> with AB and AC.
</p>
<p>
A'B'C' is perspective to ABC with perspector X(7); it is also perspective with perspector X(8) to these triangle: anticomplementary, Fuhrmann and outer-Garcia.
</p>
<p>
A'B'C' and Fuhrmann triangles are inversely similar, with X(9782) as center of inverse similitude.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,i,j) in the following list means that A'B'C' and T are homothetic with X(i) as homothetic center and X(j) as and endo-homothetic center:
