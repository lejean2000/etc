X(9311) is the trilinear pole of line X(2254)X(3667), which is the radical axis of incircle and excircles radical circle, and also the polar of X(1) wrt {circumcircle, nine-point circle}-inverter.  (Randy Hutson, February 10, 2016)

Line X(2254)X(3667) is also the line of the (degenerate) cross-triangle of Gemini triangles 7 and 8.  (Randy Hutson, November 30, 2018)

Let DEF be the intouch triangle of triangle ABC.  Let L be the line through D parallel to CA, and let C<sub>A</sub> = L&cap;AB, and define A<sub>B</sub> and B<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let L' be the line through D parallel to AB, and let B<sub>A</sub> = L'&cap;CA, and define C<sub>B</sub> and A<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let A'B'C' be the triangle having sidelines B<sub>A</sub>C<sub>A</sub>, C<sub>B</sub>A<sub>B</sub>, A<sub>C</sub>B<sub>C</sub>.  Then A'B'C' is perspective to ABC, and the perspector is X(9311).
