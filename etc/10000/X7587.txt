<h3 id="X7587">X(7587)&nbsp;=&nbsp; ENDO-HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF THESE TRIANGLES:  CIRCUMORTHIC AND EXTANGENTS</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; cos(B/2 - C/2) + sin(A/2) + 2 sin<sup>2</sup>(A/2) : :

<p>
The homothetic center of the circumorthic and extangents triangles is X(6197).  See the preamble to X(7581).
</p>
<p>
X(7587) lies on these lines:
{1, 168}, {3, 7589}, {21, 177}, {56, 174}, {236, 958}, {258, 3361}, {266, 361}, {405, 7593}, {3576, 7590}
</p>
<p>
X(7587) = homothetic center of the Yff-central triangle and 2nd circumperp triangle<br>
X(7587) = {X(56),X(174)}-harmonic conjugate of X(7588)
