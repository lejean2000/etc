Let A'B'C' be the trilinear N-obverse triangle of X(2).  Let L<sub>A</sub> be the line through A' parallel to BC, and define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  Let A" = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B" and C" cyclically.  Triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC at X(7033).  (Randy Hutson, November 30, 2018)
