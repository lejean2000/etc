Suppose that P = p : q : r and U = u : v : w (barycentrics) are points.  It is well known that the trilinear pole of the line PU, given by barycentrics 1/(rv - qw) : 1/(pw - ru) : 1/(qu - sv) , lies on the circumconic with perspector P and on the circumconic with perspector U (e.g., the trilinear pole of X(2)U is the point 1/(v - w) : 1/(w - u) : 1/(u - v), on the Steiner circumellpse.
</p>
<p>
If P lies on the circumcircle, then P is the trilinear pole of the line X(6)Q, where Q = crossdifference of X(6) and the isogonal conjugate of P; e.g., X(99) = trilinear pole of X(6)X(524), where X(524) = crossdifference of X(6) and X(512).  The appearance of (i,j,k) in the following list means that X(i), on the circumcircle, X(j) is the isogonal conjugate of X(i), and X(k) is the crossdifference of (X(6) and X(j), and X(i) is the trilinear pole of X(6)X(k).
