X(8115) is the trilinear pole of line X(3)X(2575).  This line is the major axis of the ellipse that is the locus of radical centers of circles centered at A, B, C and tangent to lines through X(3).  This ellipse is centered at X(3) and passes through (complement of X(125)) = X(5972).  (Randy Hutson, September 5, 2015)

X(8115) lies on the MacBeath circumconic, the orthic inconic, and these lines:
{2,6}, {110,1113}, {511,1114}, {648,2592}, {651,2580}, {895,2105}, {1312,3564}, {1331,1822}, {1344,6090}, {1345,1351}, {1346,1352}, {2552,5480}, {2593,2986}, {2987,8106}

X(8115) = reflection of X(8116) in X(6)<br>
X(8115) = isotomic conjugate of X(2592)<br>
X(8115) = {X(i),X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (2,323,8116), (1993,3580,8116)<br>
X(8115) = X(249)-Ceva conjugate of X(8116)<br>
X(8115) = cevapoint of X(6) and X(2574)<br>
X(8115) = X(i)-cross conjugate of X(j) for these (i,j): (525,8116), (647,1114), (2574,69)<br>
X(8115) = X(i)-iso conjugate of X(j) for these {i,j}: {1,8105}, {4,2578}, {6,2588}, {19,2574}, {25,2582}, {31,2592}, {393,2584}, {512,2581}, {523,2577}, {647,2587}, {661,1114}, {1313,2576}, {1823,2501}
