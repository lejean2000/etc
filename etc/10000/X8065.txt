Let A'B'C' be the 1st Morley triangle.  Let Ma be the line through A parallel to B'C', and define Mb, Mc cyclically.  Let A" = Mb&cap;Mc, B" = Mc&cap;Ma, C" = Ma&cap;Mb.  The triangle A''B''C'' is equilateral with center X(8011), and A''B''C'' is homothetic to A'B'C' at X(8065).  (Randy Hutson, August 12, 2015; Seiichi Kirikami, ADGEOM #1515, 8/19/2014)

(The 1st Morley-Kirikami point is X(5454).)
</p>
<p>
X(8065) lies on these lines: {16,358}, {61,5631}, {356,8011}<br>
</p>
<p>
X(8065) = {X(358),X(3275)}-harmonic conjugate of X(3280)
