Let Oa be the circle tangent to the incircle and passing through B and C, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  Let A* be the intersection, other than A, of circles Ob and Oc, and define B* and C* cyclically.  Triangle A*B*C* is perspective to ABC at X(57), and X(9940) = X(3)-of-A*B*C*.  See also X(479).
