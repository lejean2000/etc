X(7757) is the center of the ellipse that is the locus of radical centers of parametrized circles used in construction of the Brocard points:  Let A', B', C' be points on lines BC, CA, AB, resp., such that BA'/BC = CB'/CA = AC'/AB = t.  Let (Oa) be the circle passing through A and tangent to line BC at A'.  Define (Ob), (Oc) cyclically. As t varies, the radical center of (Oa), (Ob), (Oc) traces an arc of an ellipse with center X(7757).  The arc has as endpoints the 1st and 2nd Brocard points (for t = 0 and 1), and passes through  X(194) (for t = 1/2 and infinity). The non-traced section of the ellipse passes through X(2) (the antipode of X(194)).  The ellipse is the Steiner circumellipse of triangle X(194)PU(1).  The tangents to the ellipse at the 1st and 2nd Brocard points (PU(1))  intersect at the 3rd Brocard point, X(76).  Bernard Gibert notes that the ellipse also circumscribes the 3rd Brocard triangle.    (Randy Hutson, January 26, 2016)
