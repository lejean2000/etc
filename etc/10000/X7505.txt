As a point on the Euler line, X(7505) has Shinagawa coefficients (-4 F, E).

Let L<sub>A</sub> be the polar of X(4) with respect to the circle centered at A and passing through X(3), and define L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  (Note: X(4) is the perspector of every circle centered at a vertex of ABC.)  Let A' = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, B' = L<sub>C</sub>&cap;L<sub>A</sub>, C' = L<sub>A</sub>&cap;L<sub>B</sub>.  Then A'B'C' is homothetic to ABC, and the center of homothety is X(7505).  Also, A'B'C' is homothetic to the medial triangle, and the center of homothety is X(3548), and A'B'C' is homothetic to the anticomplementary triangle, and the center of homothety is X(20).  The orthocenter of A'B'C' is X(20) and the nine-point center of A'B'C' is X(1658).  (Randy Hutson, April15, 2015)
