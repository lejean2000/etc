Let Na be the Nagel point. The incircle intersects ANa at two points, the closer of which to the vertex A is denoted by A1 and the other by A2. Define B1, C1 and B2, C2 cyclically. X(8051) is the trilinear pole of the perspectrix of the triangles A1B1C1 and A2B2C2, line X(3667)X(3669). (Angel Montesdeoca, November 17, 2021)
