X(5459) is the center of the equilateral triangle formed by the nine-point centers of the triangles BCF, CAF, ABF, where F is the Fermat point, X(13). Also, X(5459) is the center of the circle through X(2), X(13), and the previously mentioned nine-point centers, and X(5459) = {X(5),X(597)}-harmonic conjugate of X(5460).

The circle just defined is here given the name <b>1st Hutson circle</b>.  The 2nd Hutson circle and Hutson-Parry circles are defined at X(5460) and X(5466); see also X(8371).  (CK, October 31, 2015)

X(5459) = reflection of X(5460) in X(5461)<br>
X(5459) = complement of X(5463)<br>
X(5459) = radical center of the polar circles of triangles BCX(13), CAX(13), ABX(13)<br>
