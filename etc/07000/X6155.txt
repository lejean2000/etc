<h3 id="X6155">X(6155)&nbsp;=&nbsp; BICENTRIC SUM OF PU(113)</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = (b + c)(2a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2ab + 2ac)
<p>
Suppose that X = x : y : z (trilinears) is a triangle center.  The points P(X) = y/z : z/x : x/y and U(X) = z/y : x/z : y/x are introduced at
<a href="BicentricPairs.html" class="bold">Bicentric Pairs</a> as the 1st and 2nd bicentric quotients of X, respectively.  The pair is both a bicentric pair and an isogonal conjugate pair.  As an example, P(X(2)) and U(X(2)) are the 1st and 2nd Brocard points.  The points PU(113) are the bicentric quotients of X(37) = b + c : c + a : a + b, so that PU(113) consists of the following bicentric pair:  P(X(37)) = (a + c)/(a + b) : (b + a)/(b + c) : (c + b)/(c + a) and U(X(37)) = (a + b)/(a + c) : (b + c)/(b + a) : (c + a)/(c + b).  The bicentric sum of two points p : q : r and u : v : w is the point p + u : q + v : r + w.  For the bicentric difference of PU(113), see X(4983).
