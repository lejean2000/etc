X(5961) is the Hofstadter 4 point and the antigonal image of X(5964), in accord with the following conjecture and corollary:
<i class="bold">If r is an integer other than 0, 1, or 2, then the inverse-in-circumcircle of the Hofstadter r point is the
Hofstadter (2-r) point; thus, since the isogonal conjugate of the Hofstadter r point is the Hofstadter (1-r) point, if r is not -1, 0 or
1, then the antigonal image of the Hofstadter r point is the Hofstadter -r point.</i><b></b> (Randy Hutson, August 10, 2014)

<p>
The Hofstadter r point is defined at X(359), where further examples are given.

Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the Kosnita triangle. The circumcircles of A&prime;BC, B&prime;CA, C&prime;AB concur in X(5961). (Randy Hutson, August 10, 2014)

<p>
X(5961) lies on these lines: {3,125}, {24,136}, {94,96}, {186,476}, {1989,2079}
</p>
<p>
X(5961) = isogonal conjugate of X(5962)<br>
X(5961) = complement of X(39118)<br>
X(5961) = circumcircle-inverse of X(265)<br>
