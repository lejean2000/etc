X(6376) is the center of the conic W = {{A,B,C,X(668), X(789), X(799), X(811), X(1978), X(4554), X(4593), X(4602)}.  W is the isotomic conjugate of the antiorthic axis, as well as the the isogonal conjugate of the line X(667)X(788). (Randy Hutson, February 16, 2015)

<p>
The conic W is also the locus of the trilinear pole of a line that varies through the set of all lines through X(75), as well as the locus of the trilinear product of the two Steiner circumellipse intercepts of a line that varies through the set of all the lines through X(2).  The trilinear polar of X(6376) passes through X(3835).  (Randy Hutson, February 16, 2015)
