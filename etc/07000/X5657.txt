Let A* be the parabola with focus A and directrix BC, and let A** be the polar of X(1) with respect to A*. Define B** and C** cyclically, and let A&prime; = B**&cap;C**, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically. The lines AA&prime;, BB&prime;, CC&prime; concur in X(1000),
and the centroid of A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is X(5657). (Randy Hutson, July 7, 2014)
