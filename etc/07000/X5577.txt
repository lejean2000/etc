<p>The inverter of circles (U,u) and (V,v) is introduced here as the
circle (W,w) such that (V,v) is the inverse-in-(W,w) of (U,u), where W
is the insimilicenter of (U,u) and (V,v).</p>

<p>Peter Moses (Nov. 12, 2013) found representations for W and w, as
follows. The center W of (W,w) is the combo uV + vU; that is,
barycentrics for W are given by u(v<sub>A</sub>, v<sub>B</sub>,
v<sub>C</sub>) + v(u<sub>A</sub>, u<sub>B</sub>, u<sub>C</sub>), where
(u<sub>A</sub>, u<sub>B</sub>, u<sub>C</sub>) are normalized
barycentrics for U, and (v<sub>A</sub>, v<sub>B</sub>, v<sub>C</sub>)
are normalized barycentrics for V. The radius of (W,w) is w = sqrt[uv(1
- (|UV|/(u + v))<sup>2</sup>], so that the inverter is real if and only
if u + v &gt;= |UV|. Moses also gave properties for the case that (U,u)
= (O,R) = circumcircle and (V,v) = (I,r) = incircle, for which the
inverter is given by (W,w) = (X(55), (r/(r + R))sqrt(rR +
4R<sup>2</sup>)). The power of A with respect to (W,w) is</p>

<p>- abc(b + c - a)<sup>2</sup>/D, where D = 2(a<sup>3</sup> +
b<sup>3</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>b - a<sup>2</sup>c -
ab<sup>2</sup> - ac<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup>c - bc<sup>2</sup>);
likewise, (power of B) = - abc(a - b + c)<sup>2</sup>/D and (power of
C) = - abc(a + b - c)<sup>2</sup>/D.</p>

<p>The alternate inverter of circles (U,u) and (V,v) is introduced here
as the circle (W&prime;,w') such that (V,v) is the inverse-in-(W,w) of (U,u),
where W&prime; is the exsimilicenter of (U,u) and (V,v). The center W&prime; is the
combo uV - vU, and the radius w' of W&prime; is given by sqrt[uv(- 1 +
(|UV|/(u - v))<sup>2</sup>], so that the alternate inverter is real if
and only if |u - v| &lt;= |UV|. (Peter Moses, September 3, 2014)</p>

<p>The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that X(i) is on
the circumcircle, X(j) is on the incircle, and each is the
inverse-in-(W,w) of the other: (98, 5578), (99, 5579), (100, 3021),
(101, 5580), (103, 1364), (105, 11), (106, 5577), (108, 1360), (109,
1362), (840, 3025), (934, 3321), (939, 5582), (972, 3318), (1381,
2447), (1382, 2446), (1477, 1357), (2222, 3322), (2291, 3022), (2384,
5583), (2717, 3326).</p>

<p>The barycentrics for X(5577) are of the form g(a,b,c) : g(b,c,a) :
g(c,a,b), where g(a,b,c) = a<sup>2</sup>(b + c - a)(b -
c)<sup>2</sup>[b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup> -
kbc]<sup>2</sup>, where k is a homogeneous of degree zero and symmetric
in (a,b,c); every such point lies on the incircle. (Peter Moses, August
28, 2014)</p>
