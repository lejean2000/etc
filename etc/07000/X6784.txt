Let P and P* be antipodes on the circumcircle.  Let Q be the intersection, other than P, of the circumcircle and line X(6)P.  Let G' be the centroid of the (degenerate) pedal triangle of P.  Then G' is the crossdifference of P* and Q.  The locus of G' as P varies is an ellipse centered at X(2), with major axis line X(2)X(2574), and passing through X(125), X(3756), X(5642), X(6784), X(6786), X(6791) and X(6793).  This ellipse is homothetic to the Hutson centroidal ellipse (defined at X(5943)), with insimilicenter X(373) and exsimilicenter X(51).<br>
The reflection of P in G' lies on the orthocentroidal circle, and is P of the orthocentroidal triangle.

X(6784) lies on the above described ellipse and these lines: {2,6786}, {51,2871}, {98,6785}, {115,512}, {125,526}, {373,597}, {511,6055}
</p>
<p>
X(6784) = reflection of X(6786) in X(2)<br>
X(6784) = midpoint of X(98) and X(6785)<br>
X(6784) = crossdifference of every pair of points on line X(99)X(1625)
