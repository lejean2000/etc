Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = b^2 c^2 (-a^2 b^2-a^2 c^2+b^2 c^2)
<p>
"SS(a &#8594; bc)" denotes the barycentric symbolic substitution a &#8594; bc, b &#8594;ca, c &#8594; ab, which carries lines to lines, conics to conics, cubics to cubics, etc.; see X(6337).
</p>
<p>
X(6374) is the center of conic {{A,B,C,X(670),X(689),X(1978)}}.  (This conic is the isogonal conjugate of line X(669)X(688, which is the trilinear polar of X(32)), and it is also the isotomic conjugate of the Lemoine axis.
</p>
<p>
As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(76), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(6374).  As W varies through the set of all conics that pass through the isotomic conjugates of the incenter and the excenters, the locus of the center of W is X(6374).  (Randy Hutson, February 16, 2015)
