<p>The 2nd Kenmotu circle has center X(372) and passes through the six
contact points of the congruent squares in the construction of the 2nd
Kenmotu point. Let Let A&prime; be the pole of line BC with respect to the
2nd Kenmotu circle, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically. The lines AA&prime;,
BB&prime;, CC&prime; concur in X(5419). (Randy Hutson, February 9, 2013)</p>

<p>X(5419) lies on the conic {A, B, C, X(2), X(1173)} and these lines:
{371, 1600}, {372, 5446}, {492, 640}, {5413, 6420}, {5417, 5421}
</p>
<p>X(5419) = isogonal conjugate of X(5420)</p>
