Let ABC be a triangle with orthic triangle DEF, and let L be a line
in the plane of ABC. Let A&prime; be the reflection of A in L, and define B&prime;
and C&prime; cyclically. The circumcircles of DB&prime;C&prime;, EC&prime;A&prime;, FA&prime;C&prime; concur.

If L is the Euler line of ABC, then the circumcircles concur in X(5099).&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Seiichi Kirikami, September 25, 2013.

X(5099) is the center of hyperbola H = {{A,B,C,X(4),X(23)}}.  H is the isogonal conjugate of line X(3)X(67) and the isotomic conjugate of line X(67)X(69).  Also, H passes through X(316), X(842), X(1383).  Moreover, H intersects the circumcircle at X(842) and is tangent to line X(4)X(67) at X(4).  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015)

As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(2492), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(5099).  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2014)

Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the orthic triangle.  Let La be the Fermat axis of triangle AB&prime;C&prime;, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A&Prime; = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  The lines A&prime;A&Prime;, B&prime;B&Prime;, C&prime;C&Prime; concur in X(5099), which is X(3)-of-A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime;.
