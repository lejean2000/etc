<p>Let d be a line tangent to the nine-point circle of a triangle ABC.
Let D<sub>A</sub> be the reflection of d in line BC, and define
D<sub>B</sub> and D<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let XYZ be the triangle
formed by the lines D<sub>A</sub>, D<sub>B</sub>, D<sub>C</sub>. The
envelope of the circumcircle of the variable triangle XYZ is a circle.
(Tran Quang Hung, ADGEOM #1387, July 9, 2014). The circle is here named
the Hung circle.</p>

<p>The diameter of the Hung circle is the segment X(3)X(1614), so that
X(5944) is the midpoint of this segment. The radius of the circle is
(R/2)(3 + k)/(1 + k), where k = 2(cos 2A + cos 2B + cos 2C). The lines
AX, BY, CZ concur in a point Q = Q(P) on the circumcircle of ABC. The
appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that X(j) = Q(X(i)):

(2039,98), (2040,98). (C&eacute;sar Lozada, ADGEOM #1388 et al, July 9,

<p>The triangles XYZ form a family of similar triangles, and Q is the
incenter of XYZ. If P = p : q : r is a point on the nine-point circle,
then</p>

<p>Q = Q(P) = a<sup>2</sup>/[p(v + w) - u(q + r)] : b<sup>2</sup>/[q(w
+ u) - v(r + p)] : c<sup>2</sup>/[r(u + v) - w(p + q)],</p>

<p>where u : v : w = X(5). (Peter Moses, August 1, 2014)</p>

<p>If ABC is acute, then Q is the incenter of XYZ, and XYZ has the
orientation opposite that of ABC. Let J = |OH|/R and &sigma; =
area(ABC). Maximal area(XYZ) = &sigma;(J - 1)/(J + 1) occurs with P =
X(1312) and minimal area(XYZ) = &sigma;(J + 1)/(J - 1) occurs with P =
X(1313). If ABC is not acute, then Q is an excenter of XYZ, and XYZ has
the same orientation as ABC. In this case, maximal area(XYZ) =
&sigma;(J + 1)/(J - 1) occurs with P = X(1313) and minimal area(XYZ) =
0, which occurs when angle X(5)-to-P-to-X(4) is a right angle and XYZ
is a one of the points of intersection of the circumcircle and the Hung
circle. Also, there is a local maximum when P = X(1312), and in this
case, area(XYZ) = &sigma;(J - 1)/(J + 1). (Peter Moses, August 9,
2014)</p>

<p>Let A&prime; be the reflection of X(5) in line BC, and define B&prime; and C&prime;
cyclically. Let A&Prime; be the circumcenter of triangle BCA&prime;, and define
B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. The lines A&prime;A&Prime;, B&prime;B&Prime;, C&prime;C&Prime; concur in
X(5944). (Randy Hutson, August 17, 2014)</p>
