Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the anticomplementary triangle of triangle ABC. Let A&Prime; be the reflection of A&prime; in the perpendicular bisector of segtment
BC, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. Let A<sub>1</sub> be the touchpoint of the incircle of A&Prime;BC and line BC, and let A<sub>2</sub> be the touchpoint of the incircle of A&prime;BC and line BC. Define the points B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> cyclically. Then |AC<sub>2</sub>| = |BC<sub>1</sub>|, |BA<sub>1</sub>| = |CA<sub>2</sub>|, |CB<sub>1</sub>| = |AB<sub>2</sub>|, so that by Carnot's theorem, the six points A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>2</sub>, B<sub>1</sub>, B<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub> lie on a conic, named in honor of Alexander Privalov. A barycentric equation for the Privalov conic follows:
</p>
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> + f(a,b,c)yz + f(b,c,a)zx + f(c,a,b)xy = 0, where f(a,b,c) = 2[(b - c)<sup>2</sup> + a<sup>2</sup>]/[(b - c)<sup>2</sup> - a<sup>2</sup>],
<p></p>
or, equivalently, by
<p></p>
x<sup>2</sup> + y<sup>2</sup> + z<sup>2</sup> - g(A,B,C)yz - g(B,C,A)zx - g(C,A,B)xy = 0, where g(A,B,C) = tan(B/2) tan(C/2)
[cot<sup>2</sup>(B/2) + cot<sup>2</sup>(C/2)]. (Dmitry Grigoriev, April 15, 2013.)

The Privalov conic is the bicevian conic of X(7) and X(8) - that is, the conic through the vertices of the intouch and extouch triangles.
Its center X(5452) is also the center of the conic through A, B, C, X(101), X(294), X(651), X(666), which is the isogonal conjugate of the Gergonne line. Also, X(5452) = crossdifference of every pair of points on the polar of X(6) with respect to the incircle. See also X(5545). &nbsp;&nbsp; (Randy Hutson, April 19, 2013)</p>

As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(55), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(5452).  (Randy Hutson, April 19, 2013)

Let L be a line tangent to the incircle.  Let P and U be the circumcircle intercepts of L.  Let X be the crossdifference of P and U.  As L varies, X traces the circumellipse centered at X(5452).  This ellipse shares a major axis with, and is homothetic to, the Privalov conic.  Therefore, the Privalov conic is an ellipse for every triangle ABC.  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the orthic triangle.  Let La be the Gergonne line of triangle AB&prime;C&prime;, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A&Prime; = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  Triangle A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is inversely similar to ABC, with similicenter X(5452).

Let P be a point on the circumcircle.  Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the anticevian triangle of P.  A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is perspective to the unary cofactor triangle of the intangents triangle for all P.  As P varies, the perspector traces the circumconic centered at X(5452).
