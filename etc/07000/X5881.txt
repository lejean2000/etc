<p>Let A&prime; be the reflection of X(40) in A and let A&Prime; be the reflection
of X(40) in line BC. Define B&prime;, C&prime;, B&Prime;, and C&Prime; cyclically. The lines
A&prime;A&Prime;, B&prime;B&Prime;, C&prime;C&Prime; concur in X(5881). Also, X(5881) = (X(20) of the
Fuhrmann triangle). (Randy Hutson, July 7, 2014)</p>

<p>More generally, suppose that X is a point in the plane of triangle
ABC, and let A&prime; be the reflection of X in A and A&Prime; be the reflection
of X in line BC. Define B&prime;, C&prime;, B&Prime;, and C&Prime; cyclically. The triangles
A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; and A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; are perspective if X lies on the Darboux cubic.
The perspector is here called the Darboux image of X. The appearance of
(i,j) in the following list means that X(j) is the Darboux image of the
point X(i) on the Darboux cubic: (1,4312), (3,381), (4,4), (20,5921),
(40,5881), (64,5922), (80,5923), (1490,5924), (1498,5925).</p>

<p>If X is on the Darboux cubic and P is the perspector of ABC and the
pedal triangle of X, then the Darboux image of X is the reflection of X
in P. (Randy Hutson, July 18, 2014)</p>
