X(6589) is the perspector of a rectangular circumhyperbola referenced in connection with cyclologic triangles and the nine-point center.  See

As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(124), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(6589).  (Randy Hutson, February 20, 2014)

X(6589) lies on these lines:  {230,231}, {649,834} et al.

X(6589) = X(2)-Ceva conjugate of X(124)<br>
X(6589) = crossdifference of every pair of points on line X(3)X(10)<br>
X(6589) = (trilinear polar of X(4))&cap;(trilinear polar of X(58)<br>
X(6589) = perspector of the hyperbola {{A,B,C,X(4),X(58)}} (centered at X(124))
