"SS(a &#8594; S<sub>A</sub>)" denotes barycentric symbolic substitution, similar to trilinear symbolic substitution defined at X(3221).  Here, substituting S<sub>A</sub>, S<sub>B</sub>, S<sub>C</sub> for a,b,c in the barycentrics for X(9) yields X(6337).  Symbolic substitution carries lines to lines, conics to conics, and cubics to cubics.  For example, since X(1), X(2), X(3), X(4), X(6), X(9), X(57), X(1073), X(1249) lie on the Thomson cubic, their images under SS(a &#8594;S<sub>A</sub>) lie on the cubic given by

+ y(S<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub>z<sup>2</sup> - S<sup>2</sup><sub>C</sub>x<sup>2</sup>) + z(S<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub>x<sup>2</sup> - S<sup>2</sup><sub>A</sub>y<sup>2</sup>) = 0.

The following four circles intersect in two points, and their crossum is X(6337):  (1) circumcircle, (2) 2nd Lemoine circle, (3) {{X(371),X(372),PU(1),PU(39)}} (whose center is X(32)), and (4) {{X(4),X(194),X(3557),X(3558)}} (whose center is X(3095).  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015)

As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(69), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(6337).  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015)

Let A&prime; be the trilinear product of the vertices of the A-adjunct anti-altimedial triangle, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically.  Triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is the anticomplementary triangle of the 1st Brocard triangle, and is perspective to ABC at X(4), and to the medial triangle at X(6337).
