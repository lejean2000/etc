Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the orthic triangle, and let L<sub>A</sub> be the
reflection of line B&prime;C&prime; in the internal bisector of angle A, and define
L<sub>B</sub> and L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A&Prime; =
L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. The
triangle A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is homothetic to ABC at X(57), homothetic to the
medial triangle at X(908), and to the anticomplementary triangle at
X(5905). Let M<sub>A</sub> be the reflection of the line B&prime;C&prime; in the
external bisector of angle A, and define M<sub>B</sub> and
M<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A* = M<sub>B</sub>&cap;M<sub>C</sub>, and
define B* and C* cyclically. The triangle A*B*C* is homothetic to ABC
at X(9), homothetic to the medial triangle at X(5249), and to the
anticomplementary triangle at X(5905). (Randy Hutson, July 7, 2014)</p>
