: f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = a(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> +

<p>Let P be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC with orthocenter H.
Let DEF be the excentral triangle of ABC. The circumcircles of APD,
BPE, CPF concur in two points, P and Q. The point Q = Q(P) is the
Gibert-Burek-Moses concurrent circles image of P. The points X(1), P,
Q(P) are collinear, and circumcenters of APD, BPE, CPF are collinear.
Let L denote the line of the circumcenters; then Q is the reflection of
P in L. Examples: Q(X(3)) = X(484), Q(X(4)) = X(3465), Q(X(15)) =
X(1276), Q(X(16)) = X(1277), Q(X(20)) = X(5018). &nbsp;&nbsp; (Peter
Moses, June 16, 2013)</p>

<p>The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that Q(X(i)) =
X(j):<br>
(36, 40), (46, 2077), (74, 3464), (100,1054), (105,1282), (109, 1768),
(165, 1155), (759, 2948), (1381, 2449), (1382, 2448) &nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Let O denote the imaginary circle with center X(1) and squared
radius -4rR. Then Q(P) is the O-inverse of P; see Bernard Gibert's
"Antiorthocorrespondents of Circumconics," <i>Forum Geometricorum</i> 3
(2003) 231-249. Accordingly, if U is an arbitrary circle, then Q(U) is
a circle; here "circle" includes lines, regarded as circles of infinite
radius. Examples: Q(circumcircle) = Bevan circle; Q(Euler line) is a
circle with center X(3737); Q(antiorthic axis) is a circle with center
X(3476); If P is a point on the circumcircle, then Q(P) is the Brisse
transform of P with respect to the tangential triangle of the excentral
triangle of ABC. (This paragraph is based on notes received from
Bernard Gibert and Randy Hutson, July 17-19, 2013.)</p>

<p>Let P be given by barycentrics p : q : r. Then Q is given by</p>

<p>Q = g(a,b,c,p,q,r) : g(b,c,a,q,r,p) : g(c,a,b,r,p,q), where
g(a,b,c,p,q,r) = a[bcp<sup>2</sup> - caq<sup>2</sup> - abr<sup>2</sup>
+ (a - b - c)(aqr - bpr - cpq)] &nbsp;&nbsp; (Peter Moses, June 16,

The latter has a movable point P.</p>
