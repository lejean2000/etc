<p>Many triangle centers are constructible as isogonal conjugates with
respect to a central triangle T other than ABC. See, for example, the
preamble to X(2883). Other examples are X(5642), for which T is the
Thomson triangle, and X(5957), for which T is the Feuerbach triangle.
In the latter case, a long formula for barycentric coordinates is given
for the Feuerbach isogonal conjugate of an arbitrary point p : q : r is
given. Peter Moses (August 11, 2014) developed a much longer formula
for the isogonal conjugate of a point p : q : r with respect to a
triangle having vertices d1 : d2 : d3, e1 : e2 : e3, f1 : f2 : f3. The
total number of characters in the formula is (pending). Although too
long to be stated here, the formula served as a basis for finding
triangle centers X(i) for i = 6000-6030.</p>

<p>For well-established central triangles T, (e.g., Thomson, Feuerbach,
intouch, extouch), the phrase "isogonal conjugate with respect to T can
be shortened to "T isogonal conjugate" or "T-I C&Prime;, as in many of the
next triangle centers.</p>

<p>It T is a triangle, then T-isogonal conjugation carries points on
the circumcircle of T to the line at infinity. For example, taking T =
Brocard triangle, the appearance of (X(i),X(j)) in the following list
means that T-I C of X(i) is X(j): (3,2782), (6,804), (1083,2795),
(1316,690), (5091,2787), (5108,543).</p>

<p>In each of the next examples (i,j), the point X(i) lies on the
incircle, and X(j), the intouch-IC-of-X(i), lies on the line at
infinity: (1317,517), (1356,6002), (1357,3667), (1358,3309),
(1360,971), (1361,5151), (1362,516), (1364,522), (1365,6003), (2446,
3307), (2447,3308), (3020,6004), (3021,518), (3022,514), (3023,512),
(3024,523), (3025,900), (3026,6005), (3027,511), (3028,30), (3318,521),
(3319,2800), (3320,1503), (3322,2801), (3323,2820), (3325,1499),
(3326,3738), (3327,1510), (3328,3887), (5577,6006), (5579,6007),
(5580,520), (5581,6008), (5582,6009)</p>
