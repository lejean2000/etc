The locus of the centroid of the pedal triangle of P as P varies
around the nine-point circle is an ellipse with center X(5943). Also,
X(5943) is the centroid of the pedal triangle of X(5), as well as the
centroid of the 6 points of intersection of the nine-point circle and
the sidelines of ABC. (Randy Hutson, July 18, 2014). The ellipse is
here named the Hutson centroidal ellipse.

Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be any one of the following nine triangles:  medial, 1st Brocard, McCay, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, inner Napoleon, outer Napoleon, inner Vecten, outer Vecten; and let Ba and Ca be the orthogonal projections of B&prime; and C&prime; on BC, respectively.  Define Cb and Ac cyclically, and define Ab and Bc cyclically.  X(5943) is the centroid of {Ba, Ca, Cb, Ab, Ac, Bc}.  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)

<p>X(5943) lies on these lines:
{2,51}, {5,389}, {6,1196}, {22,5092}, {23,5643}, {25,182}, {30,5892}</p>
<p>
X(5943) = midpoint of X(i) and X(j) for these (i,j): (2,51), (5,5946)<br>
X(5943) = complement of X(3917)<br>
X(5943) = {X(51),X(373)}-isoconjugate of X(2)</p>
