<p>Paul Yiu introduced this point on New Year's Day, January 1, 2014.
He noted that X(74) is the unique point whose reflections in the
sidelines of triangle ABC are collinear and perspective to ABC. The
perspector is X(5627). The line of the reflections is perpendicular to
the Euler line at X(4), and the rectangular circumhyperbola through
X(5627), here called the Yiu hyperbola, YH, has asymptotes parallel and
perpendicular to the Euler line. The center of YH is X(3258), and the
perspector of YH is X(1637); YH meets the circumcircle in X(477), which
is the reflection of X(74) in the Euler line. &nbsp;&nbsp; (Paul Yiu,
ADGEOM, "An easy new year puzzle", January 1, 2014)</p>

<p>The line tangent to YH at X(5627) is parallel to the line
X(74)X(1138). The axes of YH are the Wallace-Simson lines of X(74) and
X(110). The Steiner circumellipse meets YH in four points: A, B, C, and
X(5641). The isogonal conjugate of YH is the line X(3)X(74). X(5627) is
the cevapoint of the 1st and 2nd Fermat Points. &nbsp;&nbsp; (Peter
Moses, January 2, 2014)</p>

<p>X(5627) is the perspector of ABC and the reflection of the Euler
triangle in the Euler line. &nbsp;&nbsp; (Randy Hutson, Jan. 8,

Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the tangential triangle of the Kiepert hyperbola. Let
A&Prime; be the intersection, other than X(3258) of the nine-point circle
and the line A&prime;X(3258); define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically. The lines AA&Prime;,
BB&Prime;, CC&Prime; concur in X(5627). &nbsp;&nbsp; (Randy Hutson, Jan. 8,
2014)

<p>
Let P = X(110) and A1A2, B1B2, C1C2 be the diameters of the circumcircle of ABC, parallel to AP, BP, CP, respectively.  The Simson-Wallace lines of the points A1 and A2 intersect orthogonally in Pa, on the nine-point circle. The points Pb and Pc are defined similarly.  The triangles ABC and PaPbPc are perspective and inversely similar; the perspector is X(5627).  (Angel Montesdeoca, October 21, 2018)
