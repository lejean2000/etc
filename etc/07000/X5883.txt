<h3 id="X5883">X(5883)&nbsp;=&nbsp; X(51) OF FUHRMANN TRIANGLE</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; a^2(b + c) + 2abc - (b + c)(b^2 - 3bc + c^2) : :
<p>
Let T be the orthic triangle of the Fuhrmann triangle (whose
vertices are the incenters of the three altimedial triangles); then
X(5883) = centroid of T. Let T' be the triangle whose vertices are the
centroids of the altimedial triangles; then X(5883) = incenter of T'.
