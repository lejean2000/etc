Let A&prime; be the intersection, other than X(4), of the A-altitude and the orthosymmedial circle, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically.  Triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is here introduced as the 1st orthosymmedial triangle.  A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is inversely similar to ABC, with similitude center X(251).  X(6792) is X(111) of A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;.

Let A&Prime; be the intersection, other than X(6), of the A-symmedian and the orthosymmedial circle, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.  Triangle A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is here introduced as the 2nd orthosymmedial triangle.  A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is the circummedial triangle of A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;.  A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; and A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; are perspective at X(51).

Let A&prime; be the trilinear product of the vertices of the A-adjunct anti-altimedial triangle, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically.  Triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is the anticomplementary triangle of the 1st Brocard triangle and is similar to the orthocentroidal triangle, with similitude center X(6792).
