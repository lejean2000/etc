Trilinears&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) =  sec^2(A/2) [- a^2 cos B cos C sec^2(A/2) + b^2 cos C cos A sec^2(B/2) + c^2 cos A cos B sec^2(C/2)]

Barycentrics&nbsp;&nbsp; g(a,b,c) : g(b,c,a) : g(c,a,b), where g(a,b,c) = [a^6 - 2a^5(b + c) - a^4(b + c)^2 + 4a^3(b^3 + c^3) - a^2(b^2 - c^2)^2 - 2a(b - c)^2(b + c)(b^2 + c^2) + (b - c)^2(b + c)^4]/(b + c -a)

<p>X(5932) is the perspector of these three triangles: 3rd extouch,
anticevian of X(7), and extraversion of X(7). Also, X(5932) is the
perspector of ABC and the pedal triangle of X(3182), as well as the
perspector of ABC and the triangle obtained by reflecting the pedal
triangle of X(223) in X(223). (Randy Hutson, July 11, 2014)</p>
