Barycentrics&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = a[a^5(b + c) - a^4(b^2 + c^2) - a^3(b + c)(2b^2 - 3bc + 2c^2) + 2a^2(b^4 - b^3c - b^2c^2 - bc^3 + c^4) + a(b - c)^2(b^3 + c^3) - (b - c)^4(b + c)^2]  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015)
<p>X(5885) is the nine-point center of the Fuhrmann triangle of the
orthic triangle of the Fuhrmann triangle. (Randy Hutson, July 7,
2014)</p>
<p>Let T be the orthic triangle of the Fuhrmann triangle (whose
vertices are the incenters of the three altimedial triangles); then
X(5885) = X(5)-of-T. Let T' be the triangle whose vertices are the
nine-point centers of the altimedial triangles; then X(5885) = incenter
of T'. (Randy Hutson, July 18, 2014)</p>
<p>X(5885) lies on these lines:
{1,3}, {2,5694}, {5,2771}, {140,758}, {143,2392}, {575,2836}, {912,3812}, {952,3754}, {1656,5693}, {1772,2594}, {3526,5692}, {3628,3833}, {3874,5690}, {3881,5844}</p>
<p>X(5885) = complement of X(5694)</p>
