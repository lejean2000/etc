<p>X(5628) and several other triangle centers are perspectors of each
pair of the following triangles in the plane of a triangle ABC:<br>
T1 = 1st Morley triangle; MathWorld: First Morley triangle<br>
T2 = 2nd Morley triangle; MathWorld: Second Morely triangle, etc.<br>
T3 = 3rd Morley triangle&gt;<br>
T4 = 1st adjunct Morley triangle; MathWorld: First adjunct Morley
triangle, etc.)<br>
T5 = 2nd adjunct Morley triangle<br>
T6 = 3rd adjunct Morley triangle<br>
T7 = 1st p-Morley triangle (defined below)<br>
T8 = 2nd p-Morley triangle<br>
T9 = 3rd p-Morley triangle<br>
T10 = 1st p-adjunct Morley triangle (defined below)<br>
T11 = 2nd p-adjunct Morley triangle<br>
T12 = 3rd p-adjunct Morley triangle<br>
</p>

<p>The p-Morley triangles T7, T8, T9 have as vertices the points of
intersection of pairs of perpendiculars to trisectors at corresponding
vertices that form T1, T2, T3, respectively. For example, T7 is formed
as follows from the 1st Morley triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;: let L<sub>B</sub> be
the line perpendicular to BA&prime; at B, let L<sub>C</sub> be the line
perpendicular to CA&prime; at C; then the A-vertex of T7 is
L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and the B-vertex and C-vertex are
defined cyclically. Similarly, the p-adjunct Morley triangles T10, T11,
T12 are defined from T4, T5, T6.</p>
