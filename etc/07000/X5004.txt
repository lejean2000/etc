As a point on the Euler line, X(5004) has Shinagawa coefficients ((E + 4F)S + abc(2S<sub>&omega;</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>, -4(E + F)S - 3abc(2S<sub>&omega;</sub>)<sup>1/2</sup>).

X(5004) is the point in the plane of triangle ABC whose tripolar
distances are proportional to ((b<sup>2</sup> +
c<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, (c<sup>2</sup> +
a<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>, (a<sup>2</sup> +
b<sup>2</sup>)<sup>1/2</sup>). Like X(5000) and X(5002), the point
X(5004) lies on the Euler line; unlike X(5000) and X(5002), this point
is real-valued when ABC is obtuse.

<p>
X(5004) is the circumcircle-inverse of X(5005). The midpoint of X(5004) and X(5005) is X(23). Of the two points, X(5004) is the one outside the circumcircle. (Peter Moses, March 7, 2012)

X(5004) and X(5005) are the two points whose pedal antipodal perspectors (defined at Hyacinthos #20403 and #20405) are both X(6).  (Randy Hutson, Febrary 20, 2015)
