X(5375) is the center of the circumconic with perspector X(100).
This conic passes through the bicentric pairs P(26), U(26), and P(33),
U(33) (Randy Hutson, 9/10/2012) and is a hyperbola (Peter Moses,
10/10/2012). It is introduced here as the Hutson-Moses hyperbola,
discussed in the preamble to X(5376).</p>
<p>X(5375) lies on these lines:
{44, 3290}, {100, 650}, {101, 661}, {190, 4467}, {644, 3239}, {651,
3676}, {666, 693}, {901, 4394}, {908, 3008}, {2323, 4700}

X(5375) = complement of X(8047)<br>
X(5375) = X(2)-Ceva conjugate of X(100)<br>
X(5375) = complementary conjugate of complement of X(16686)<br>
X(5375) = crosssum of circumcircle intercepts of line PU(27) (line X(244)X(665))<br>
