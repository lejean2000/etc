<h3 id="X6018">X(6018)&nbsp;=&nbsp; INTOUCH-ISOGONAL CONJUGATE OF X(519)</h3>
Barycentrics&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = a^2 (a-b-c) (a b+b^2+a c-4 b c+c^2)^2
<p>Let A&prime; be the point of intersection, other than X(11), of the
Mandart inellipse and the incircle that is farthest from A; define B&prime;
and C&prime; cyclically. A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is here named the Mandart-incircle triangle.
It is homothetic to ABC at X(55), to the medial triangle at X(11), to
the Euler triangle at X(12), and to the anticomplementary triangle at
X(497). X(6018) = X(106)-of-Mandart-incircle triangle. (Randy Hutson,

<p>X(6018) lies on the incircle and these lines:
{1,1357}, {8,3038}, {10,11}, {12,5510}, {55,106}, {56,1293}, {65,4661}, {354,4701}, {988,3242}, {1054,1697}, {1317,2827}, {1320,3271}, {1356,4890}, {1358,3663}, {1361,2815}, {1362,2821}, {1364,2098}, {2776,3028}, {2789,3027}, {2796,3023}, {2810,3022}, {2832,3021}, {2840,3318}, {2842,3024}, {2843,6019}, {2844,6020}, {2899,5178}, {3025,5048}, {3616,4731}, {3624,3893}, {3626,4004}, {3632,3698}, {3635,4002}, {3679,3962}, {3753,4746}, {3922,4668}, {4005,5836}, {4533,4691}
