Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 4a csc(A - &pi;/3) + b csc(B - &pi;/3) + c csc(C - &pi;/3) : : &nbsp;&nbsp; (Randy Hutson, April 25, 2013)
<p>
X(5460) is the center of the equilateral triangle formed by the nine-point centers of the triangles BCF', CAF', ABF', where F' = X(14).  Also, X(5460) is the center of the circle through X(2), X(14), and the previously mentioned nine-point centers. (Randy Hutson, April 25, 2013)
</p>
<p>
The circle just described is here given the name <b>2nd Hutson circle</b>.  The 1st Hutson and Hutson-Parry circles are defined at X(5459) and X(5466); see also X(8371).  (CK, October 31, 2015)

X(5460) lies on these lines:
{2, 14}, {5, 542}, {13, 9166}, {18, 671}, {30, 5479}, {62, 5470}, {115, 395}, {148, 9116}, {396, 5471}, {524, 624}, {543, 618}, {599, 636}, {629, 2482}, {3524, 5474}, {3545, 6773}, {3643, 9761}, {5055, 5613}, {5321, 6672}, {5476, 7684}, {8371, 9195}

<p>
X(5460) = reflection of X(5459) in X(5461)<br>
X(5460) = complement of X(5464)<br>
X(5460) = {X(5),X(597)}-harmonic conjugate of X(5459)<br>
X(5460) = radical center of the polar circles of triangles BCX(14), CAX(14), ABX(14)<br>
X(5460) = radical trace of 2nd Hutson and Hutson-Parry circles
