The term "homologous" means "having the same relation or relative position to".  Let T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> be two triangles, and P a point in the plane of triangle T<sub>1</sub>.  The point P&prime; in the plane of triangle T<sub>2</sub> is a <b>T<sub>1</sub>-to-T<sub>2</sub> homologous image of P</b> if P&prime; has the same relation or relative position to T<sub>2</sub> as P has to T<sub>1</sub>.  If T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are similar triangles, this meaning is unambiguous, and we call P&prime; the <b>T<sub>1</sub>-to-T<sub>2</sub> similarity image of P</b>.  If, however, T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are not similar, the term "homologous images" can apply to several kinds of mappings.  We present three such mappings here.<br>
</p>
<p>
<b>Trilinear image:</b>
</p>
<p>
Let P be a point with trilinears x : y : z wrt T<sub>1</sub>.  Then the <b>T<sub>1</sub>-to-T<sub>2</sub> trilinear image of P</b> is the point P&prime; with trilinears x : y : z wrt T<sub>2</sub>.  This is a non-affine collineation, preserving collinearities, but not ratios of distances between collinear points.  Parallel lines do not remain parallel under this mapping, so that points on the line at infinity map to finite points.  Circumconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to circumconics of T<sub>2</sub> and inconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to inconics of T<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Barycentric image:</b>
</p>
<p>
Let P be a point with barycentrics x : y : z wrt T<sub>1</sub>.  Then the <b>T<sub>1</sub>-to-T<sub>2</sub> barycentric image of P</b> is the point P&prime; with barycentrics x : y : z wrt T<sub>2</sub>.  This is an affine collineation, preserving collinearities as well as ratios of distances between collinear points.  Parallel lines remain parallel under this mapping, so that the line at infinity maps to itself.  Conics map to conics of the same type (ellipses, including circles, map to ellipses, parabolas to parabolas, hyperbolas to hyperbolas).  Circumconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to circumconics of T<sub>2</sub> and inconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to inconics of T<sub>2</sub>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Functional image:</b>
</p>
<p>
Let the sidelengths of T<sub>1</sub> be denoted a<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>1</sub>, c<sub>1</sub> and the sidelengths of T<sub>2</sub> be denoted a<sub>2</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, c<sub>2</sub>.  Let P be a point with coordinates f(a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>1</sub>) : g(b<sub>1</sub>,c<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>) : h(c<sub>1</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>,b<sub>1</sub>) with respect to T<sub>1</sub>, where f, g, h either have the same degree of homogeneity, or else one is the zero function and the other two have the same degree of homogeneity.  (If P is a center of T<sub>1</sub>, then f = g = h.)  Then the <b>T<sub>1</sub>-to-T<sub>2</sub>-functional image of P</b> is the point P&prime; with coordinates f(a<sub>2</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>) : g(b<sub>2</sub>,c<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>) : h(c<sub>2</sub>,a<sub>2</sub>,b<sub>2</sub>) with respect to T<sub>2</sub>.  Coordinates here can be trilinears or barycentrics, as long as the same system is used for T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>.  P&prime; serves the same 'function' wrt T<sub>2</sub> (e.g., centroid, circumcenter, 1st Brocard point, A-vertex of orthic triangle, etc.) as P serves wrt T<sub>1</sub>.  For example, the orthic-to-excentral functional image of X(5) = X(40), since X(5) and X(40) are the respective circumcenters of the orthic and excentral triangles.  This is a non-affine collineation, preserving collinearities, but not ratios of distances between collinear points (except where these distance ratios define the point, such as midpoints, reflections, etc.).  Parallel lines remain parallel under this mapping, so that the line at infinity maps to itself.  Circles map to circles.  Other conics map to conics, but not necessarily of the same type (e.g., the MacBeath circumconic of T<sub>1</sub> may be an ellipse, but maps to the MacBeath circumconic of T<sub>2</sub>, which may be a hyperbola.)  Circumconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to circumconics of T<sub>2</sub> and inconics of T<sub>1</sub> map to inconics of T<sub>2</sub>.
