Let U&prime;, V&prime;, W&prime; be the congruent squares as described at X(371), but
with two vertices each on the extended sides of triangle ABC, and
having common vertex X(372). Let L<sub>A</sub> be the extended diagonal
of U&prime; that does not contain X(372), and define L<sub>B</sub> and
L<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let A&prime; = L<sub>B</sub>&cap;L<sub>C</sub>, and
define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically. The triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is homothetic to the
orthic triangle, and the center of homothety is X(5413). Also, A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;
is homothetic to the tangential triangle at X(6), to the intangents
triangle at X(5414), and to the extangents triangle at X(5416); A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is named the 2nd Kenmotu diagonals triangle at X(31).  (Randy Hutson, February 9, 2013)</p>
