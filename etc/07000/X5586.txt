<h3 id="X5586">X(5586)&nbsp;=&nbsp; PERSPECTOR OF AQUILA AND INTOUCH TRIANGLES</h3>
Barycentrics&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b),
where f(a,b,c) = (a - b + c)(a + b - c)(3a + b + c)(a + 2b + 2c)

<p>Let A&prime; = reflection of the incenter in A, and define B&prime; and C&prime;
cyclically. The triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is introduced here as the Aquila
triangle (in TCCT, , p. 173, as T(1,2)). The following properties were found by Peter Moses (Nov. 18,
2013).
</p>
<p>
A&prime; = a + 2b + 2c : -a : -a (trilinears)<br>
B&prime; = -b : b + 2c + 2a : -b<br>
C&prime; = -c : -c : c + 2a + 2b<br>
area(A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;) = 4*area(ABC).
</p>
<p>
The Aquila triangle is perspective to the following triangles with
perspector X(1): ABC, excentral, incentral, mid arc, 2nd circumperp, and mixtilinear. The Aquila triangle is perspective to
other triangles with perspectors as listed here: medial, X(1698);
anticomplementary, X(10); intouch, X(5586); Euler, X(1699); hexyl,
X(1768); tangential 1st circumperp, X(35); tangential 2nd circumperp,
X(36); Carnot, X(5587); outer Grebe, X(5588); inner Grebe, (X5589).</p>

<p>X(5586) lies on these lines:
{1,376}, {7,10}, {57,191}, {65,3632}, {145,4298}, {388,4114}, {942,4312}, {986,4888}, {1046,4859}, {1317,3340}, {1537,1768}, {1698,3715}, {1788,3982}, {3361,3616}, {3485,4031}, {3600,3635}, {3633,5434}
