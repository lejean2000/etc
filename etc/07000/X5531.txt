f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = a<sup>5</sup> - 3a<sup>4</sup>(b + c) +

<p>Four of the circles that are tangent to two of the sidelines BC, CA,
AB pass through X(11), namely, the incircle and 3 others. The centers
of those 3 are collinear. (See Barry Wolk's Hyacinthos messages #21431,
#21433, etc., January 2013). Let A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; be the triangle formed by the
radical axes of these circles and the corresponding mixtilinear
excircle. A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is homothetic to the hexyl triangle, and the center of
homothety is X(5531). Moreover, X(5531) is the Fuhrmann-triangle-to-excentral triangle similarity image of X(40).  Further, in the definition of X(5495), if A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is
the excentral triangle, then the circumcircles of T<sub>A</sub>,
T<sub>B</sub>, T<sub>C</sub> concur in X(5531). Also, X(5531) is the
inverse of X(1) in the circumcircle of O<sub>A</sub>, O<sub>B</sub>,
O<sub>C</sub>. &nbsp;&nbsp; (Randy Hutson, July 18, 2013)</p>
