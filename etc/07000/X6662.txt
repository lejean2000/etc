Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 1/[b^2 cos^2(C - A) + c^2 cos^2(A - B) - a^2 cos^2(B - C)] : :
<p>
Let G' be the centroid of the quadrilateral {A,B,C,X(3)}, and let U be the reflection of the cevian triangle of X(3) in G'.  Then ABC and U are perspective, and X(6662) is their perspector.  The trilinear polar of X(6662) passes through X(1637).  (Randy Hutson, February 24, 2015)
