X(6591) is the perspector of a rectangular circumhyperbola referenced in connection with cyclologic triangles and the nine-point center.  See

As a line L varies through the set of all lines that pass through X(5521), the locus of the trilinear pole of L is a circumconic, and its center is X(6591).  (Randy Hutson, February 20, 2014)
