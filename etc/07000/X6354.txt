<h3 id="X6354">X(6354)&nbsp;=&nbsp; (X(1),X(115))-ANSWER TO QUESTION A</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = (a+b-c)^2 (a-b+c)^2 (b+c)^2
<p>
Question A is copied here from X(554):  Suppose that X and Y are triangle centers. Let
</p>
<p>
Y<sub>A</sub> = (Y of the triangle XBC),
Y<sub>B</sub> = (Y of the triangle XCA),
Y<sub>C</sub> = (Y of the triangle XAB).
</p>
<p>
Let A&prime; = XY<sub>A</sub>&cap;, and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically. In Clark Kimberling, "Major Centers of Triangles," <I>Amer. Math. Monthly</I> 104 (1997) 431-438, Question A is this: for what choices of X and Y do the lines AA&prime;, BB&prime;, CC&prime; concur? A solution (X,Y) is called the (X,Y)-answer to Question A.  Answers X(6354)-X(6359) were contributed by Peter Moses, January 28, 2015, in conjunction questions raised by Viktor Kitaisky.

See X(554) for a list of major centers that provide answers to Question A.  In the following list, the appearance of (i,j) means that X(j) is a non-major center which is the (X(1),X(i))-answer to Question A:  (115,6354), (125,12), (135,6355), (136,6356), (155,84), (231,6357), (249,2185), (250,757), (254,347), (338,6358), (339,1089), (401,894), (421,6359), (426,612), (436,144), (454,1256)  (Peter Moses, January 28, 2015)
