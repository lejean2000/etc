Let U denote the Brocard circle.  X(5108) is the intersection, other than X(6), of line X(2)X(6) and U.  Also, X(5108) is the intersection, other than X(3), of U and the circle with segment X(2)X(3) as diameter, and X(5108) is the intersection, other than X(2), of line X(2)X(6) and the circle with segment X(2)X(3) as diameter.  Also, X(5108) is the intersection, other than X(1316), of U and the circle {{X(2), X(110), X(1316)}}, which is the Parry circle of the 1st Brocard triangle.  Let V denote the circle {{X(2), X(110), X(2770), X(5463), X(5464)}}.  Then X(5108) = inverse-in-V of X(3).  (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2015)
