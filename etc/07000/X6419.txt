<p>
The 1st Lucas secondary tangents triangle is introduced at X(6199).
</p>
<p>
X(6419) lies on these lines: {3,6}, {4,1327}, {485,1132}, {486,3068}, {1994,5408}, {2066,3301}, {2067,3299}, {3518,5413}, {5198,5410}, {5409,5422}, {5412,5417} .
</p>
<p>
X(6419) = perspector of Lucas secondary central triangle and circumsymmedial tangential triangle<br>
X(6419) = radical center of Lucas(6) circles<br>
X(6419) = {X(i),X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k): (3,6,6420), (6,371,372), (6,1151,3312), (6,3311,371), (61,62,371)
