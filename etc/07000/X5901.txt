As at X(5886), let A&prime; be the nine-point center of the triangle IBC,
where I = X(1), and define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically; then X(5901) = (X(5)
of A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;), as well as the complement of X(5) with respect to A&prime;B&prime;C&prime;.
Let A* be the circle with center A and diameter b + c, and define B*
and C* cyclically; then X(5901) is the radical center of A*, B*, C*.
Let A&Prime; be the nine-point center of triangle IBC, and define B&Prime; and
C&Prime; cyclically; then I, A&Prime;, B&Prime;, C&Prime; comprise an orthocentric system
whose common nine-point circle has center X(5901). (Hyacinthos #21518,
