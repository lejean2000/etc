<h3 id="X6161">X(6161)&nbsp;=&nbsp; BICENTRIC SUM OF PU(114)</h3>
Trlinears &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; f(a,b,c) : f(b,c,a) : f(c,a,b), where f(a,b,c) = (b - c)(2a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> - 2ab - 2ac)
<p>
Suppose that X = x : y : z (trilinears) is a triangle center.  The points P(X) = y/z : z/x : x/y and U(X) = z/y : x/z : y/x are introduced at
<a href="BicentricPairs.html" class="bold">Bicentric Pairs</a> as the 1st and 2nd bicentric quotients of X, respectively.  The pair is both a bicentric pair and an isogonal conjugate pair.  As an example, P(X(2)) and U(X(2)) are the 1st and 2nd Brocard points.  The points PU(114) are the bicentric quotients of X(513) = b - c : c - a : a - b, so that PU(114) consists of the following bicentric pair:  P(X(513)) = (a - c)/(a - b) : (b - a)/(b - c) : (c - b)/(c - a) and U(X(513)) = (a - b)/(a - c) : (b - c)/(b - a) : (c - a)/(c - b).  For the bicentric difference of PU(114), see X(2087).
