<p><i>Two triangles are mutually polar with respect to a conic if each edge of one is the polar of a vertex of the other.</i></p>
<p><i>Two triangles are perspective if and only if they are mutually polar with respect to a conic.</i>. (Lord, Eric (2013). <i>Symmetry and Pattern in Projective Geometry</i>, (pp 88). London: Springer).</p>
<p>The conic with respect to which two perspective triangles T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are mutually polar are here named the <b>mutual polar conic of T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub></b>. A list of these conics involving ABC and some triangles can be seen in <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/PolarTriangle.html">Wolfram's Polar Triangle</a>.</p>
<p>If T' = A'B'C' is a central triangle perspective to ABC with perspector P = u:v:w (trilinears) then there exists a function f(a,b,c) such that AA'=f(a,b,c)*AP, BB'=f(b,c,a)*BP and CC'=f(c,a,b)*CP (in particular, if T' and ABC are homothetic then f(a,b,c) is a constant). The center O of the mutual polar conic of ABC and T' has trilinears O = u/f(a,b,c) : v/f(b,c,a) : w/f(c,a,b) (O=P if ABC and T' are homothetic). The perspector of this conic is P.</p>
<p>The appearance of (T, n) in the following list means that the center of the mutual polar conic of ABC and T is X(n) (ABC and T non-homothetic):</p>
