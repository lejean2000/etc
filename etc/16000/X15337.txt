Let Ab, Ac be the contact points of the B- and C-excircles with line BC, respectively.  Let Ha be the hyperbola with Ab and Ac as foci and B and C as vertices.  Let La be the line through the intersections, other than B and C, of Ha and lines CA and AB; define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A' = Lb&cap;Lc, B' = Lc&cap;La, C' = La&cap;Lb.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(15337).  (Randy Hutson, November 22, 2017)
