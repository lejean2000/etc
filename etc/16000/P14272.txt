"Let F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, F<sub>3</sub> be three figures in perspective two and two in the same plane, show that if they have a common centre of perspective, their three axes of perspective are concurrent."   (Quoted from Lachlan, R.: <I>An Elementary Treatise on Modern Pure Geometry</I>, McMillan &amp; Co., 1893,  pp. 123).
<p>
For three triangles T<sub>1</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>3</sub> satisfying the those conditions, the point of concurrence of the three axes is here named the <b>triaxial point of the triangles</b>.
</p>
<p>
Among thousands of triaxial points, centers X(14272)-X(1353) have been selected for this section.
