<p>
Using barycentric coordinates, suppose that P = p : q : r and U = u : v : w are a bicentric pair of points.  Let
<p>
P' = line p*x + q*y + r*z = 0<br>
U' = line u*x + v*y + w*z = 0<br>
L = a line<br>
P* = L&cap;P'<br>
U* = L&cap;U'<br>
X = a point on L<br>
X' = (P*,U*)-harmonic conjugate of X, to be expressed as <b>L(P,U)-harmonic conjugate of X</b>
</p>
<p>
If L is a central line and X is a triangle center, then X' is a triangle center. For example, if X is on the Euler line, then X' is on the Euler line, for every choice of bicentric pair (P,U), and the point X' in this case is written as <b>Euler(P,U)-harmonic conjugate of X</b>.  If X is on the Brocard axis, then X' is written as <b>Brocard(P,U)-harmonic conjugate of X</b>.
