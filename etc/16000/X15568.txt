Another construction for points Ab, Ac, Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb on this conic: Let A'B'C' be the excentral triangle, and Aa'Ab'Ac', Ba'Bb'Bc', Ca'Cb'Cc' the A-, B-, and C-extouch triangles.  Then Ab = B'C' &cap; Bb'Bc', Ac = B'C' &cap; Cb'Cc', and cyclically for Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb. (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)
</p>
<p>
Ab and Ac are also the B- and C-excircle-inverses of A, resp., and cyclically for Bc, Ba, Ca, Cb.  (Randy Hutson, August 15, 2020)

X(15568) lies on these lines: {1,210}, {374,966}</p>
