Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; a^2(5a^8 - 11a^6(b^2 + c^2) + a^4(3b^4 + 23b^2c^2 + 3c^4) + a^2(7b^6 - 13b^4c^2 - 13b^2c^4 + 7c^6) - (b^2 - c^2)^2(4b^4 + 7b^2c^2 + 4c^4)) : :
<p>
The homothetic center of these triangles is X(3091).
</p>
<p>
The X(20)-altimedial triangle is also the X(4)-Brocard triangle (see X(5642)).  It is homothetic to the orthocentroidal triangle at X(3091), and to the X(2)-Brocard triangle and X(5)-Brocard triangle at X(3).  It is inversely similar to ABC with similitude center X(15062).

<p>
X(15051) lies on these lines: {2,7687}, {3,74}, {6,15053}, {20,5972}, {113,376}, {125,3523}, {140,12121}, {146,5642}, {265,549}, {548,7728}, {550,10721}, {631,15059}, {3090,12295} et al

<p>
X(15051) = endo-homothetic center of every pair of these triangles: {orthocentroidal, X(20)-altimedial, X(20)-anti-altimedial}<br>
