Let Ai, Ae be the contact points of the incircle and A-excircle with line BC, resp.  Let Ea be the ellipse with Ai and Ae as foci and B and C as vertices.  Let La be the line through the intersections, other than B and C, of Ea and lines CA and AB; define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A' = Lb&cap;Lc, B' = Lc&cap;La, C' = La&cap;Lb.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(15339).  (Randy Hutson, November 22, 2017)
