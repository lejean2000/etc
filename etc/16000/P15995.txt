The Garcia reflection triangle is introduced here as follows.  Let A' be the excenter of a triangle ABC, and define B' and C' cyclically.  Let A'' be the midpoint of segment BC, and define B'' and C'' cyclically.  Let A* be the reflection of A' in A'', and define B* and C* cyclically.  Emmanuel Jose Garcia conjectured that the triangle A*B*C*, here named the <b>Garcia reflection triangle,</b> is perspective to the outer-Garcia triangle.  CÃ©sar Lozada proved (January 28, 2018) that the conjecture is true.  He found barycentric coordinates:
</p>
<p>
A* = a : c - a : b - a<br>
B* = c - b : b : a - b<br>
C* = b - c : a - c : c
</p>
<p>
Lozada also noted that A*B*C* is perspective to other triangles.  The appearance of (T,n) in the following list means that A*B*C* is perspector to T and that the perspector is X(n).  An asterisk ( * ) means that the triangles are homothetic:
</p>
<p>
(anticomplementary, 8), (Atik, 8), (2nd circumperp, 21), (Conway, 21), (2nd Conway, 8), (3rd Conway, 1), (excenters-midpoints*, 2), (excenters-reflections, 3680), (excentral, 9), (2nd extouch, 9), (Fuhrmann, 8), (outer-Garcia, 8), (hexyl, 1), (Honsberger, 2346), (Hutson intouch, 1), (outer-Hutson, 7707), (incircle-circles, 1), (intangents, 1), (intouch, 1), (inverse-in-incircle, 7), (medial, 9), (6th mixtilinear, 1), (2nd Pamfilos-Zhou, 7133), (Pelletier, 3309), (2nd Schiffler*, 11), (1st Sharygin, 21), (inner-Soddy, 15995), (outer-Soddy, 15996), (tangential-midarc, 15997), (Yff central, 7707)
</p>
<p>
Lozada established that A*B*C* is orthologic to other triangles. The appearance of (T,m,n) in the following list means that X(m) = A*B*C*-to-T orthologic center and X(n) = T-to-A*B*C* orthologic center:
</p>
<p>
(ABC, 1, 8), (ABC-X3 reflections, 1, 944), (anti-Aquila, 1, 10), (anti-Ara, 1, 12135), (5th anti-Brocard, 1, 12195), (anti-Euler, 1, 12245), (anti-Mandart-incircle, 1, 3913), (anticomplementary, 1, 145), (Aquila, 1, 3632), (Ara, 1, 12410), (Ascella, 8, 12437), (Atik, 8, 12448), (1st Auriga, 1, 12454), (2nd Auriga, 1, 12455), (5th Brocard, 1, 12495), (1st circumperp, 8, 12513), (2nd circumperp, 8, 3913), (inner-Conway, 8, 3621), (Conway, 8, 12536), (2nd Conway, 8, 12541), (3rd Conway, 8, 12546), (Euler, 1, 355), (3rd Euler, 8, 12607), (4th Euler, 8, 3813), (excenters-midpoints, 3680, 12640), (excenters-reflections, 8, 3680), (excentral, 8, 2136), (extouch, 4, 8), (2nd extouch, 8, 12625), (Fuhrmann, 1320, 10912), (inner-Garcia, 80, 3632), (outer-Garcia, 1, 1), (Gossard, 1, 12626), (inner-Grebe, 1, 12627), (outer-Grebe, 1, 12628), (hexyl, 8, 12629), (Honsberger, 8, 12630), (Hutson extouch, 15998, 12632), (inner-Hutson, 8, 12633), (Hutson intouch, 8, 8), (outer-Hutson, 8, 12634), (incircle-circles, 8, 3244), (intouch, 8, 145), (inverse-in-incircle, 8, 5836), (Johnson, 1, 1482), (inner-Johnson, 1, 10912), (outer-Johnson, 1, 12635), (1st Johnson-Yff, 1, 2099), (2nd Johnson-Yff, 1, 2098), (Lucas homothetic, 1, 12636), (Lucas(-1) homothetic, 1, 12637), (Mandart-incircle, 1, 10950), (medial, 1, 1), (5th mixtilinear, 1, 145), (6th mixtilinear, 8, 11519), (2nd Pamfilos-Zhou, 8, 12638), (1st Schiffler, 6597, 6598), (2nd Schiffler, 3680, 12641), (1st Sharygin, 8, 12642), (tangential-midarc, 8, 12643), (2nd tangential-midarc, 8, 12644), (3rd tri-squares-central, 1, 13911), (4th tri-squares-central, 1, 13973), (X3-ABC reflections, 1, 12645), (Yff central, 8, 12646), (inner-Yff, 1, 12647), (outer-Yff, 1, 10573), (inner-Yff tangents, 1, 12648), (outer-Yff tangents, 1, 12649)
</p>
<p>
Lozada also proved that A*B*C* is parallelogic to other triangles. The appearance of (T,m,n) in the following list means that X(m) = A*B*C*-to-T parallelogic center and X(n) = T-to-A*B*C* parellelogic center:  (1st Parry, 1, 13250), (2nd Parry, 1, 13251), (2nd Sharygin, 8, 13252)
</p>
<p>
The Garcia reflection triangle A*B*C*  has the same area as the reference triangle ABC, and the points A, B, C, A*, B*, C* lie on the Feuerbach hyperbola. (Emmanuel Garcia, March 3, 2018)
</p>
<p>
A* is the orthocenter of BCX(1), and cyclically for B*, C*.  The Garcia reflection triangle is also the Gemini triangle 8, and the reflection of the 2nd Schiffler triangle in X(11).  (Randy Hutson, June 7, 2019)
