The gamma triangle &Gamma;(T) of a triangle T is defined as the triangle having vertices the isogonal conjugates of the orthopoints of the sidelines of T. (TCCT, 6-46, pp. 178-179). From this definition, it is clear that every member of a set of homothetic triangles has the same gamma-triangle.
</p>
<p>
It is proved in the given reference that if T is not a degenerated triangle then T and &Gamma;(T) are similar. Their center of similitude will be named here as the <b>gamma-center of similitude of T</b>.
