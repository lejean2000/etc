<h3 id="X15573">X(15573)&nbsp;=&nbsp;CENTER OF THE PERSPECONIC OF THESE TRIANGLES: 1st ANTI-BROCARD AND MEDIAL</h3>
Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; (b^2+c^2)*(2*a^6+(b^2+c^2)*a^4-(b^4+c^4)*a^2-b^6-c^6)  :  :
<p>
The conic is degenerate, consisting of two intersecting lines. (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)
