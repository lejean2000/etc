Barycentrics &nbsp;&nbsp; 1/[(a^4 - b^4 - c^4 + b^2c^2)(2a^2 - b^2 - c^2)] : :
<p>
Let P be a point on the circumcircle.  Let U = &#923;(trilinear polar of P).  Then P is also &#923;(trilinear polar of U), and P and U are collinear with X(2).
Let P* and U* be the points P and U which minimize |PU|.  P* and U* have X(2) as midpoint, and are the circumcircle intercepts of the perpendicular to the Euler line through X(2).
X(10415) is the cevapoint of P* and U*.

<p>
X(10415) lies on these lines: {4,10422}, {23,671}, {67,524}, {523,10562}

X(10415) = isogonal conjugate of X(6593)<br>
X(10415) = isotomic conjugate of X(7664)<br>
