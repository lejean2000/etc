Several anti-triangles have been previously defined in ETC, including anti-Brocard triangles, anti-McCay and anti-Artzt.  Associated with anti-triangles are composite triangles.  For example, there are pairs of much-studied triangles whose composite is simply the reference triangle; e.g., the (2nd circumperp triangle of circumorthic triangle) = ABC; and conversely, (circumorthic triangle of 2nd circumperp) = ABC. Further examples of such paris include these:
</p>
<p>
2nd circumperp, circumorthic<br>
2nd Euler, hexyl<br>
excentral, orthic<br>
Johnson, Johnson<br>
intouch, tangential
</p>
<p>
The following table shows selected anti-triangles in column, along with a construction and trilinear coordinates for the A-vertex.  Column 2 shows triangles perspective with the anti-triangle.  (See supplementary notes following the table.)
