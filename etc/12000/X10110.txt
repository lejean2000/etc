Let P  be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, and<br>
A'B'C' = pedal triangle of P<br>
Ba = orthogonal projection of B' on AB, and define Cb and Ac cyclically<br>
Ca = orthogonal projection of C' on AC, and define Ab and Bc cyclically<br>
Ea = Euler line of ABaCa, and define Eb and Ec cyclically<br>
La = locus of P such that Ea is perpendicular to BC, and define Lb and Lc cyclically
</p>
<p>
The point X(5) lies on all three lines, La, Lb, Lc.  The point of concurrence of Ea, Eb, Ec is X(10110).

A second construction of X(10110), this time as the center of a circle, follows:
</p>
<p>
Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of the orthocenter, H, of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
Ab = orthogonal projecton of A' on HB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Ab = orthogonal projecton of A' on HB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Abc = midpoint of AbC', and define Bca and Cab cyclically<br>
Acb = midpoint of AcB', and define Bac and Cba cyclically<br>
The six points, Abc, Bca, Cab, AcB, Bac, Cba, lie on a circle, of which the center is X(10110).
