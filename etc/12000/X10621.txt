Let O be the circumcenter of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
Ab = reflection of A' in OB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Ac = reflection of A' in OC, and define Ba and Cb cyclically<br>
Na = nine-point center of AAbAc, and define Nb and Nc cyclically<br>
Oa = circumcenter of AAbAc, and define Ob and Oc cyclically<br>
E = Euler line of ABC<br>
P = an arbitrary point on the E, regarded as a function with domain E<br>
Ea = Euler line of AAbAc, and define Eb and Ec cyclically<br>
Pa = P-of-Ea, and define Pb and Pc cyclically.  (See "functional image" in the preamble to X(6724).)

As P ranges through E, the ABC-to-PaPbPc orthologic center OC(P), ranges through a circumconic, specifically, the isogonal conjugate of the line X(184)X(9292).  Examples include X(10621) = OC(X(4)) and X(10622) = OC(X(5)), as well as X(264) = OC(X(2)) and X(1975) = OC(X(3)).
