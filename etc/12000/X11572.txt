Let P be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
A'B'C' = pedal triangle of P<br>
Ab = reflection of B' in PA', and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Ac = reflection of C' in PA', and define Ba and Cb cyclically<br>
A2 = orthogonal projection of A on PAb, and define B2 and C2 cyclically<br>
A3 = orthogonal projection of A on PAc, and define B3 and C3 cyclically<br>
N1 = X(5)-of-AA2A3, and define N2 and N3 cyclically.

The locus of P for which ABC and N1N2N3 are orthologic is the Euler line of ABC.  Henceforth, assume that P is on the Euler line, and let Pa = P-of-AA2A3, and define Pb and Pc cyclically.  Then ABC and PaPbPc are orthologic.  Then locus of the PaPbPc-to-ABC orthologic center is a set of lines through a fixed point.  The fixed point is X(11572).
