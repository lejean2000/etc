Let La be the line that is the locus of trilinear poles of tangents to the A-excircle, and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  (Note that the Gergonne line is the locus of trilinear poles of tangents to the incircle, so that La is the A-extraversion of the Gergonne line.)  Let A' = Lb&#8745;Lc, B' = Lc&#8745;La, C' = La&#8745;Lb.  (Note that A' is also the insimilicenter of the circles having as diameters segments CA and AB; and cyclically for B' and C'.)  X(10180) = X(2)-of-A'B'C'. The triangle A'B'C' is here named the <b>Gergonne line extraversion triangle</b>; A'B'C' is also the complement of the cevian triangle of X(75).

The Gergonne line extraversion triangle is also the Gemini triangle 15.  (Randy Hutson, November 30, 2018)
