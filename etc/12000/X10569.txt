<h3 id="X10569">X(10569)&nbsp;=&nbsp;HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF INVERSE-IN-INCIRCLE TRIANGLE AND CROSS-TRIANGLE OF ATIK AND INVERSE-IN-INCIRCLE TRIANGLE</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; cos A (1 + cos B + cos C) + cos<sup>2</sup> B + cos<sup>2</sup> C - 2 cos B - 2 cos C - 7 : :
<p>
Note that the Atik triangle is bound by the polars of the incenter in the excircles, and the inverse-in-incircle triangle is bound by the polars of the excenters in the incircle.
