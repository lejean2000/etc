The <b>inverse-in-incircle triangle</b> has vertices the incircle-inverses of A, B, C. The A-vertex of this triangle has trilinear coordinates:<br>
A'=((b+c)*a-(b-c)^2)/a/(-a+b+c)  : 1 : 1<br><br>
The appearance of (T,n) in the following list means that T and the inverse-in-circle triangles are perspective with perspector X(n), where an asterisk * indicates homothetic triangles  and symbols $- inversely similar triangles: <br>
