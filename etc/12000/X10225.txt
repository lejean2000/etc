Let P be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
Na = X(5)-of-PBC), and define Nb and Nc cyclically<br>
Nab = reflection of Na in AC, and define Nbc and Nca cyclically<br>
Nac = reflection of Na in AB, and define Nba and Ncb cyclically<br>
Sa = prependicular bisector of NbaNca, and define Sb and Sc cyclically<br>
The locus of P for which Sa, Sb, Sc concur is the union of several curves (see the reference).  For P = X(1), the point of concurrence is X(10225).  (Antreas Hatzipolakis and César Lozada, September 14, 2016.)  See <a href="http://www.hyacinthos.epizy.com/message.php?msg=24351"> 24351</a>.

X(10225) lies on these lines:  <br>
