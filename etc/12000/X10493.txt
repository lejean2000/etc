<p>
The <b>1st tangential mid-arc conic</b> is here defined as the conic that passes through A, B, C and the vertices of the 1st tangential mid-arc triangle.
It is the isogonal conjugate of line X(8076)X(10231) (the trilinear polar of X(174)), and also passes through X(10496) and X(10498).  The perspector of the conic is X(7707).
</p>
<p>
X(10493) lies on these lines: {177,6724}
</p>
<p>
X(10493) = X(2)-Ceva conjugate of X(7707)<br>
