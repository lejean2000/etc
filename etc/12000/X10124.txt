Let O be the circumcenter and N the nine-point center of a triangle ABC.  Let<br>
Ma = midpoint of OA, and define Mb and Mc cyclically<br>
Aa = orthogonal projection of Ma on NA, and define Bb and Cc cyclically<br>
Ba = orthogonal projection of Mb on NA, and define Cb and Ac cyclically<br>
Ca = orthogonal projection of Mc on NA, and define Cb and Ac cyclically<br>
M1 = midpoint of NA, and define M2 and M3 cyclically<br>
A1 = orthogonal projection of M1 on OA, and define A2 and A3 cyclically<br>
B1 = orthogonal projection of M2 on OA, and define B2 and B3 cyclically<br>
C1 = orthogonal projection of M3 on OA, and define C2 and C3 cyclically<br>
Oa = circumcenter of AaAbAc, and define Ob and Oc cyclically<br>
O1 = circumcenter of A1A2A3, and define O2 and O3 cyclically<br>
La = Euler line of OaO2O3, and define Lb and Lc cyclically<br>
L1 = Euler line of O1ObOC, and define L2 and L3 cyclically<br>
</p>
<p>
Then L1, L2, L3 concur in X(10124), which lies on the Euler line, and La, Lb, Lc concur in X(140).  (Antreas Hatzipolakis and Angel Montesdeoca, August 14, 2016.  See <a href="http://www.hyacinthos.epizy.com/message.php?msg=24036">Hyacinthos 24036</a>.)
