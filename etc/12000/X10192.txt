Let Ab be the point of intersection of the circle {{X(3),B,C}} and the line AB, and define Bc and Ca cyclically.  Let Ac be the point of intersection of the circle {{X(3),B,C}} and the line AC, and define Ba and Cb cyclically.  X(10192) is the centroid of {Ab,Ac,Bc,Ba,Ca,Cb}; see the preamble before X(8537).

Let A'B'C' be the tangential triangle.  Let Ba be the orthogonal projection of B' on line BC, and define Cb and Ac cyclically.  Let Ca be the orthogonal projection of C' on line BC, and define Ab and Bc cyclically. Then X(10192) is the centroid of {Ba,Ca,Cb,Ab,Ac,Bc}.  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)
