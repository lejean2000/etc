<p>
In connection with the Przyby&#322;owski-Bollin configuration described at X(11753), there are four remarkable triangles.  Two of them stem from X(15), and the other two from X(16).  For X(15), the two triangles are denoted by AiBiCi, associated with the incenter, and AaBbCc, associated with the A-excenter.  In order to write barycentrics for the A-vertex of each triangle, let
</p>
<p>
U = Sqrt[2(a^2+b^2+c^2+2 Sqrt[3] S)] = 2 Sqrt[SW+Sqrt[3] S].  Then
</p>
<p>
Ai = a^2 (Sqrt[3] (-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2 S) : b (Sqrt[3] b (a^2 - b^2 + c^2) + 2 S (b + U)) : c (Sqrt[3] c (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) + 2 S (c + U))
</p>
<p>
Aa = a^2 (Sqrt[3] (-a^2 + b^2 + c^2) + 2 S) : b (Sqrt[3] b (a^2 - b^2 + c^2) + 2 S (b - U)) : c (Sqrt[3] c (a^2 + b^2 - c^2) + 2 S (c - U))
</p>
<p>
The triangles AiBiCi and AaBbCc are perspective, with perspector X(15).
</p>
<p>
Let Oa = midpoint of Ai and Aa, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The points Ai, Aa, B, C lie on a circle with center Oa, and the triangle OaObOc is perspective to the excentral triangle with X(11752) as perspector.
</p>
<p>
Centers X(11753)-X(11761) are perspectors of AiBiCi with various triangles.  Centers X(11762)-X(11770) are perspectors of AaBaCa with the same triangles.  Centers X(11771)-X(11788) are analogous to X(11753)-X(11770), but based on X(16) instead of X(15).  The notations (AiBiCi)* and (AaBbCc)* represent the triangles constructed from X(16) in the manner that AiBiCi and AaBbCc are constructed from X(15).
</p>
<p>
Barycentrics for X(11762)-X11770) result from replacing U by -U in the barycentrics for X(11753)-X(11761), respectively.  Barycentrics for X(11771)-X11788) result from replacing S by -S in the barycentrics for X(11753)-X(11770), respectively.
