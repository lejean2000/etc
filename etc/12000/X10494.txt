<p>
The <b>2nd tangential mid-arc conic</b> is here defined as the conic that passes through A, B, C and the vertices of the 2nd tangential mid-arc triangle.
It is the isogonal conjugate of line X(1)X(168), and also passes through X(10497) and X(10498).  The perspector of the conic is X(10495).
</p>
<p>
X(10494) lies on these lines: {244, 10501}, {8242, 22994}, {17761, 21623}
</p>
<p>
X(10494) = X(2)-Ceva conjugate of X(10495)<br>
