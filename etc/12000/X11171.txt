<p>
Let X be a point on the Brocard circle.  The locus of the centroid of PU(1)X as X varies is a circle with center X(11171).

<p>
The locus of the centroid in a Brocard porism (triangles sharing circumcircle and Brocard inellipse with ABC) is a circle with center X(11171) and segment X(1340)X(1341) as diameter.  The circle also passes through X(2) and its antipode X(7709).
