The Johnson circle is the circumcircle of the Johnson triangle, and it is the reflection of the circumcircle of ABC in X(5).
</p>
<p>
Let P be a point not on the circumcircle of ABC.  Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of P.  Define the quasi-Simson line of P as the orthic axis of A'B'C'.  As P approaches a point Q on the circumcircle, the quasi-Simson line of P approaches the Simson line of Q.  See ADGEOM #2040, Dec 10, 2014.  X(10297) is the reflection of X(3) in its quasi-Simson line (line X(523)X(4885)). (Randy Hutson, January 29, 2018)

X(10297) = reflection of X(468) in X(5)<br>
X(10297) = complement of X(10295)<br>
X(10297) = complementary conjugate of complement of X(34802)<br>
X(10297) = inverse-in-{circumcircle, nine-point circle}-inverter of X(7493)<br>
