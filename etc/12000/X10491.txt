<h3 id="X10491">X(10491)&nbsp;=&nbsp;PERSPECTOR OF ABC AND CROSS-TRIANGLE OF ABC AND 2nd MID-ARC TRIANGLE</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; [cos(B/2) - cos(C/2)]<sup>2</sup> sec<sup>2</sup>(A/2) : :<br>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; [(b' - c')/a']<sup>2</sup> : :, where a', b', c' are the sidelengths of the excentral triangle
<p>
The <b>2nd mid-arc triangle</b> is here defined as the triangle D"E"F" introduced in the preamble before X(8075).  It is the incircle antipode of the mid-arc triangle.<br>
<br>
D" has trilinears:	(y - z)<sup>2</sup>  :  x<sup>2</sup>  :  x<sup>2</sup>,  where x = cos(A/2), y = cos(B/2), z = cos(C/2).
<br>
Let A' be the trilinear product E"*F", and define B', C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(10491).
</p>
<p>
Let (I<sub>A</sub>') be the circle tangent to the incircle and lines CA and AB, such that the incircle lies between (I<sub>A</sub>') and A.  Define (I<sub>B</sub>'), (I<sub>C</sub>') cyclically.
Let A' be the insimilicenter of (I<sub>B</sub>') and (I<sub>C</sub>'), and define B', C' cyclically.  The lines AA', BB', CC' concur in X(10491).
A'B'C' is equivalent to the cross-triangle of ABC and the 2nd mid-arc triangle.
</p>
<p>
X(10491) lies on the incircle and these lines: {555,10481}
</p>
<p>
X(10491) = SS(A&#8594;A') of X(1111), where A'B'C' = excentral triangle<br>
X(10491) = X(98)-of-mid-arc-triangle<br>
X(10491) = X(99)-of-2nd-mid-arc-triangle<br>
X(10491) = X(101)-of-intouch-triangle<br>
X(10491) = X(103)-of-Hutson-intouch-triangle<br>
X(10491) = trilinear square of X(10492)<br>
X(10491) = trilinear product of vertices of 2nd mid-arc triangle<br>
