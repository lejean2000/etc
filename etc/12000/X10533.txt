<h3 id="X10533">X(10533)&nbsp;=&nbsp;HOMOTHETIC CENTER OF 1st KENMOTU DIAGONALS TRIANGLE AND CROSS-TRIANGLE OF 1st AND 2nd KENMOTU DIAGONALS TRIANGLES</h3>
Trilinears &nbsp;&nbsp; a(tan B + tan C - tan A + 1) : :
<p>
The cross-triangle of the 1st and 2nd Kenmotu diagonals triangles is also the X(3)-Ehrmann triangle (see X(25) and X(31)), and is homothetic to the orthic triangle at X(184).  (Peter Moses, November 1, 2016, gives these barycentrics:
</p>
<p>
A-vertex of 1st Kenmotu diagonal triangle:  (a^2 (SA - S))/(SA + S) : b^2 : c^2<br>
A-vertex of 2nd Kenmotu diagonal triangle:  (a^2 (SA + S))/(SA - S) : b^2 : c^2
</p>
<p>
The cross-triangle of the 1st and 2nd Kenmotu diagonals triangles is also the cross-triangle of the inner and outer tri-equilateral triangles, and also the medial triangle of the tangential triangle.  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)
