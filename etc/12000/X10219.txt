Let A'B'C' be the pedal triangle of a point P in the plane of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
A''B''C'' = medial triangle of ABC<br>
Ab = orthogonal projection of A'' on AC, and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Ac = orthogonal projection of A'' on AC, and define Ba and Cb cyclically<br>
Ea = Euler line of AAbAc, and define Eb and Ec cyclically<br>
A* = Eb&#8745;Ec, and define B* and C* cyclically
</p>
<p>
The locus of P such that ABC and A*B*C are parallelogic is the union of two curves, K364 (a cubic through X(i) for i = 1,5,20,24,54,64,68,155,254,2917) and a curve of degree 14 in a,b,c, denoted by q4 in the reference below.
</p>
<p>
X(10219) is the A*B*C*-to-ABC parallelogic center for P = X(5).  The ABC-to-A*B*C* parallelogic center is X(2).
