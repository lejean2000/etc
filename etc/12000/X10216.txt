In the plane of a triangle ABC, let P be a point.  Let<br>
Ba = orthogonal projection of B on AP, and define Cb and Ac cyclically<br>
Ca = orthogonal projection of C on AP, and define Ab and Bc cyclically<br>
Ra = radical axis of the nine-point-circles of ABaC and ACaB, and define Rb and Rc cyclically<br>
Sa = radical axis of the nine-point-circles of ABaB and AcaC<br>
</p>
<p>
The locus of P for which the lines Ra, Rb, Rc concur is the Gibert quintic Q038, which passes through X(i) for i = 1, 4, 5 80, 1113, 1114, 1263, 2009, 2010.
