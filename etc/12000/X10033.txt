The triangles GaGbGc, G1G2G3 are perspective, and their perspector is X(10033).  Let Ea be the Euler line of OaOabOac, and define Eb and Ec cyclically; then Ea, Eb, Ec are parallel, and they concur in X(524).  Let Fa be the Euler line of NaNabNac, and define Fb and Fc cyclically.  Let A'' = Fb&#8745;Fc, and define B'' and C'' cyclically.  Then the triangles ABC and A''B''C'' are parallelogic, and the parallelogic center of ABC with respect to A''B''C'' is X(6094), the 11th Hatzipolakis-Montesdeoca point, and the parallelogic center of A''B''C'' with respect to ABC is X(10034).
