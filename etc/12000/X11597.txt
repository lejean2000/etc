Let P be a point in the plane of a triangle ABC, and let<br>
O1 = circumcenter of PBC, and define O2 and O3 cyclically<br>
Ab = orthogonal projection of O1 on the perpendicular bisectors of AC, and define Bc and Ca cyclically<br>
Ac = orthogonal projection of O1 on the perpendicular bisectors of AB, and define Ba and Cb cyclically<br>
La = Euler line of O1AbAc, and define Lb and Lc cyclically<br>
Ua = Lb&#8745;Lc, and define Ub and Uc cyclically<br>
A* = Ub&#8745;Uc, and define B* and C* cyclically.
</p>
<p>
The triangles ABC and A*B*C* are parallelogic, and the ABC-to-A*B*C* parallelogic center lies on the circumcircle of ABC.  The locus of P for which the lines La, Lb, Lc concur is the union of the circumcircle and the Jerabek hyperbola.  For P on the Jerabek hyperbola the point of concurrent of La, Lb, Lc, denote by Q(P), is the midpoint of P and X(110).  As P trace the Jerabek hyperbola, Q(P) traces the bicevian conic of X(2) and X(110).  The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that Q(X(i)) = X(j):<br>
(3,1511), (4,113), (6,6593), (54,11597), (64,11598), (74,3284), (265,11062), (2574,6), (2575,6).
