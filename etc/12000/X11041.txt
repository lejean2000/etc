X(11041) = (2*R+3*r)*X(8)-(6*R+4*r)*X(442)

<p>
The poristic locus of the Gergonne point is a circle here named the <b>Greenhill circle</b>, with the Greenhill point, X(1159), as center; see Hyacinthos #6535.
</p>
<p>
X(11041) is the antipode of X(7) in the Greenhill circle.  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

Let P be a point on the circumcircle.  The tangents at P to the incircle intersect the incircle and circumcircle at four points.  Let X(P) be the intersection of its diagonals (see Dominik Burek, ADGEOM #1427, July 21, 2014.
</p>
<p>
The locus of X(P) as P moves around the circumcircle is the Greenhill circle, with segment X(7)X(11041) as diameter.  Let Pa be the point P on arc BC such that X(P) = X(11041), and define Pb and Pc cyclically.  Then Pa, Pb, Pc are also the points on the circumcircle, other than the antipodes of A, B, C, whose Simson lines are tangent to the incircle; also, X(11041) = X(7)-of-PaPbPc.
