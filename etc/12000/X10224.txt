X(10224) = (9*R^2-2*SW)*X(3)+(7*R^2-2*SW) *X(4)

In the plane of a triangle ABC, let A'B'C' = pedal triangle of N (the nine-point center, X(5)), and let<br>
Na = N-of-PBC), and define Nb and Nc cyclically<br>
N1 = reflection of Na in NA', and define N2 and N3 cyclically<br>

<p>
The locus of a point P such that the circumcenter of N1N2N3 lies on the Euler line is an excentral circumquintic that passes through X(i) for these i:  1,3,4,54,110.  The appearance of (i,j) in the following list means that if P = X(i), then X(j) is the circumcenter of N1N2N3:  (1,5), (3, 10224), (4,5), 54,5576), (110,403).

Let A' be the reflection in BC of the A-vertex of the anticevian triangle of X(5).  Let Oa be the circumcenter of AB'C', and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  X(10224) is the circumcenter of OaObOc.  (Randy Hutson, December 10, 2016)

X(10224) lies on these lines:  {2,3}, {125,6102}, {569,8254}, {1154,5449}, {1568,5876}, {3574,5946}, {5448,5663}, {7741,8144}

X(10224) = reflection of X(i) in X(j) for these (i,j): (3,5498), (1658,10125), (10020,3628)<br>
X(10224) = anticomplement of X(10125)<br>
X(10224) = complement of X(1658)<br>
X(10224) = X(26285)-of-orthic-triangle if ABC is acute<br>
