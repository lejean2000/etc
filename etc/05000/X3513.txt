For any two points P, Q in the set {A, B, C} and arbitrary point X,
let M(X) = (|PX| + |QX|)/|PQ|. The point X that minimizes M(X) is X(3513). See

X(3513) is the point P such that the incenter of the circumcevian triangle of P is also the incenter of triangle ABC. (Randy Hutson,

X(3513) and X(3514) are the limiting points (point-circles) of the coaxal system that includes the circumcircle and incircle. Their
midpoint, X(3660), is the radical trace of the incircle and circumcircle. (Peter Moses, November 15, 2011)

In the plane of a triangle ABC, let P be a point on the line X(1)X(3), and let DEF = intouch triangle.  Let R<sub>A</sub> = reflection of AP in EF, and define R<sub>B</sub> and R<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  The lines R<sub>A</sub>, R<sub>B</sub>, R<sub>C</sub> concur in a point, P', that lies on a rectangular hyperbola that circumscribes DEF.  Let P'' = DEF-isogonal conjugate of P'. The mapping P &srarr; P'' is a projective transformation of the line X(1)X(3), and its fixed points are X(3513) and X(3514).  (Angel Montesdeoca, April 17, 2021)

X(3513) lies on this line: 1,3

X(3513) = reflection of X(3514) in X(3660)<br>
X(3513) = circumcircle-inverse of X(3514)<br>
X(3513) = incircle-inverse of X(3514)<br>
X(3513) = one of two harmonic traces of the Soddy circles; the other is X(3514)<br>
X(3513) = {X(i),X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(3514) for these (i,j): (1,57), (3,1617), (36,2078), (55,56), (65,354), (165,1420)<br>
