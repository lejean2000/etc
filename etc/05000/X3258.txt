Let P = X(477) and H=X(4); let H<sub>A</sub> be the orthocenter of
the triangle BCP. Define H<sub>B</sub> and H<sub>C</sub> cyclically.
Then H, H<sub>A</sub>, H<sub>B</sub>, H<sub>C</sub> are the vertices of
a quadrilateral that is homothetic to the cyclic quadrilateral having
vertices A, B, C, P. The center of homothety is X(3258). Moreover,
X(3258) is the anticenter of the quadrilateral ABCP. (Randy Hutson,

Let La, Lb, Lc be the lines through A, B, C, resp. parallel to the Euler line.  Let Ma, Mb, Mc be the reflections of BC, CA, AB in La, Lb, Lc, resp.  Let A' = Mb&cap;Mc, and define B' and C' cyclically.  Triangle A'B'C' is inversely similar to, and 3 times the size of, ABC.  Let A"B"C" be the reflection of A'B'C' in the Euler line of A'B'C' (line X(30)X(74)).  The triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to ABC, with center of homothety X(3258); see Hyacinthos #16741/16782, Sep 2008.  (Randy Hutson, March 25, 2016)
