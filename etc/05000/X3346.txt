Let A'B'C' be the cevian triangle of X(20).  Let A" be the orthocenter of AB'C', and define B" and C" cyclically.  The lines AA", BB", CC" concur in X(3346).  (Randy Hutson, November 18, 2015)

Let M be a point on the slideline BC of triangle ABC.  Let (AM) be the circle with diameter AM.  Let Mb be the point, other than A, in (AM)&cap;AC, and let Mc be the point, other than A, in (AM)&cap;AB.  Let Tb be the line tangent to (AM) at Mb, and let Tc be the line tangent to (AM) at Mc.  As M varies on BC, the locus of Tb&cap;Tc is a line, La.  Define Lb and Lc cyclically.  Let A' = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B' and C' cyclically.  The triangle A'B'C' is perspective to ABCF, and the perspector is X(3346).  (Angel Montesdeoca, November 11, 2017)
