<p>Continuing the discussion of points Xcom(T),
suppose that T is an arbitrary triangle, and let nT denote the
normalization of T. Let NT denote the set of these triangles, as
matrices, and let * denote matrix multiplication. Then NT is closed
under *. Also, NT is closed under matrix inversion. Consequently, (NT,
*) is a group, comparable to the group of stochastic matrices.</p>

<p>Suppose that T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub> are triangles. In many
cases, the product T<sub>1</sub>*T<sub>2</sub> is well-defined (e.g.,
TCCT, page 175). However, n(T<sub>1</sub>*T<sub>2</sub>) may not be
n(T<sub>1</sub>)*n(T<sub>2</sub>) if T<sub>1</sub> and T<sub>2</sub>
are not normalized. Therefore, it is important, when dealing with
products, to include the "n" if it is intended.</p>

<p>As a class of examples of triangles defined by matrix products,
suppose that T<sub>1</sub> is the cevian triangle of a triangle center
f : g : h (barycentrics) and that T<sub>2</sub> is the cevian triangle
of a triangle center u : v : w. The A-vertex of the triangle
T<sub>3</sub> = (nT<sub>1</sub>)*(nT<sub>2</sub>) is given by</p>

<p>u(gu + hu + gv +hw) : hv(u + w) : gw(u + v),</p>

<p>from which it can be shown that T<sub>3</sub> is perspective to the
triangle ABC, with perspector</p>

<p>P = ghu(v + w) : hfv(w + u) : fgw(u + v).</p>

<p>Also, T<sub>3</sub> is perspective to T<sub>2</sub>, with
perspector</p>

<p>Q = u(v + w)(gu + hu + gv + hw) : v(w + u)(hv + fv + hw + fu) : w(u
+ v)(fw + gw + fu + gv).</p>

<p>Thus, T<sub>3</sub> can be constructed directly from the pairs {P,
ABC} and {Q, T<sub>2</sub>}. Regarding the possibility that
T<sub>3</sub> is also perspective to T<sub>1</sub>, the concurrence
determinant for this condition factors as
F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>2</sub>F<sub>3</sub>, where</p>

<p>F<sub>1</sub> = u + v + w,<br>
F<sub>2</sub> = fu(g + h) + gv(h + f) + hw(f + g),<br>
F<sub>3</sub> = (fghuvw)<sup>2</sup>[(gu)<sup>-2</sup> -
(hu)<sup>-2</sup> + (hv)<sup>-2</sup> - (fv)<sup>-2</sup> +
(fw)<sup>-2</sup> - (gw)<sup>-2</sup>].</p>

<p>Consequently, the perspectivity holds if and only if one of the
three factors is 0, and from this result, various geometric results can
be obtained.</p>

<p><b>Example:</b> The Incentral and Medial triangles result by taking
f : g : h = a : b : c and u : v : w = 1 : 1: 1. The product
n(Incentral)*n(Medial) has vertices</p>

<p>A' = b + c : c : b &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B' = c : c +
a : a &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; C' = b : a : a + b</p>

<p>and its inverse has A-vertex A'' = bc + ca + ab : -bc - ca + ab :
-bc + ca - ab, from which B'' and C'' are obtained cyclically.</p>

<p>The product n(Medial)*n(Incentral) has A-vertex a(2a + b + c) : b(c
+ a) : c(a + b), and the inverse of this product has A-vertex (a + b +
c)(b + c) : -c(a + c) : -b(a + b).</p>

<p>Having considered the group NT of normalized triangles, we turn next
to 3-point combos based on product triangles and inverse triangles.
Recall that such a combo, denoted by Xcom(T), is defined, as in the
preamble to X(3663), by the matrix product
(x&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;z)*(nT), where nT is
the normalization of T.</p>
