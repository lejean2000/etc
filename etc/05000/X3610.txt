In a Hyacinthos message dated January 10, 2011, Jean-Louis Ayme
introduced a triangle as follows. Let R<sub>A</sub> be the radical axis
of the circumcircle and the A-excircle, and define R<sub>B</sub> and
R<sub>C</sub> cyclically. Let T<sub>A</sub> =
R<sub>B</sub>&cap;R<sub>C</sub>, and define T<sub>B</sub> and
T<sub>C</sub> cyclically. (T<sub>A</sub> is also the radical center of
the circumcircle and the B- and C- excircles.) The Ayme triangle
T<sub>A</sub>T<sub>B</sub>T<sub>C</sub> is perspective to triangle ABC
and also perspective to many other triangles. Peter Moses found that
its perspector with the cevian triangle of X(346) is X(3610). He also
found that the A-vertex of the Ayme triangle has first barycentric as
follows:
</p>
<p>
- (b + c)(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup> + 2bc) :
b(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>) : c(a<sup>2</sup> -
b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>),
</p>
<p>
from which the other two vertices are easily obtained. The Ayme
triangle is perspective to ABC with perspector X(19).
</p>
<p>
Moses found that the locus of X such that the cevian triangle of X
is perspective to the Ayme triangle is a cubic which passes through the
points X(i) for i = 1, 2, 19, 75, 279, 304, 346, 2184. A barycentric
equation for this Ayme-Moses cubic follows:
</p>
<p>
(Cyclic sum of ayz[by(a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup>)
- cz(a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>] ) = 0.
</p>
<p>
The Ayme triangle is homothetic to the incentral triangle, and the center of homothety is X(612).  (Randy Hutson, September 14, 2016)

<p>
X(3610) lies on these lines: 10,37&nbsp;&nbsp; 19,346&nbsp;&nbsp;
612,2345
</p>
<p>
X(3610) = perspector of ABC and cross-triangle of ABC and Ayme triangle<br>
