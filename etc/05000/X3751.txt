Let A'B'C' denote the inverse of the normalized hexyl triangle. Then
A', expressed in homogeneous barycentrics (i.e., not normalized), is
given by
</p>
<p>
2a(b + c) : a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> - c<sup>2</sup> :
a<sup>2</sup> - b<sup>2</sup> + c<sup>2</sup>

In general, if a triangle DEF is perspective to a given triangle GHI
from a point P and also perspector to another triangle JKL from a point
Q, then, clearly, lines joining P to G, H, I, and line joining Q to
J,K,L concur in pairs to form DEF. Thus, if constructions are known for
G,H,I,P,J,K,I,Q, then a construction for DEF easily follows. In
particular, the triangle A'B'C' can be constructed in several ways, as
it is perspective to the following triangles with perspectors:
</p>
<p>
ABC from X(4), orthic triangle from X(4), medial triangle from X(2),
intouch triangle from X(65), extouch triangle from X(10), Euler
triangle X(4)
