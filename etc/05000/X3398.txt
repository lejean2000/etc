X(3398) and related points occupy Bernard Gibert's Table 38. See the note at X(3364).
</p>
<p>
Randy Huston, September 5, 2015, gives three constructions of X(3398):
</p>
<p>
(1)  Let X be the 2nd Brocard point of pedal triangle of 1st Brocard point.  Let Y be the 1st Brocard point of pedal triangle of 2nd Brocard point.  Then X(3398) is the vertex conjugate of X and Y.
</p>
<p>
(2) Let U be the circle {{X(371),X(372),PU(1),PU(39)}} and V the 2nd Brocard circle.  Then X(3398) is the center of the inverse-in-U of V.
</p>
<p>
(3) Let A'B'C' be the 3rd Brocard triangle.  Let Oa be the circumcenter of A'BC, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The lines AOa, BOb, COc concur in X(3398).
</p>
<p>
X(3398) lies on these lines: 3,6&nbsp;&nbsp; 5,83&nbsp;&nbsp; 140,325&nbsp;&nbsp; 384,2782&nbsp;&nbsp; 597,1576
</p>
<p>
X(3398) = midpoint of X(1342) and X(1343)<br>
X(3398) = isogonal conjugate of X(3399)<br>
X(3398) = inverse-in-Brocard-circle of X(3095)<br>
X(3398) = crosssum of X(3102) ande X(3103)<br>
X(3398) = harmonic center of circumcircle and 1st Lemoine circle<br>
X(3398) = harmonic center of 1st and 2nd Brocard circles<br>
X(3398) = X(3)-of-5th-anti-Brocard-triangle<br>
X(3398) = radical center of circumcircles of ABC, 5th Brocard triangle, and 5th anti-Brocard triangle<br>
X(3398) = {X(i),X(j)}-harmonic conjugate of X(k) for these (i,j,k):  (32,182,3), (371,372,3094), (1687,1688,39)
