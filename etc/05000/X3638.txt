In the plane of triangle ABC, let X,Y,Z be the points of contact of the incircle with sidelines BC,CA,AB, and let X',Y',Z' be the harmonic conjugates of X,Y,Z with respect to {B,C}, {C,A}, {A,B}, respectively. It is well known that AX, BY, CZ concur in the Gergonne point, X(7), and that X',Y',Z' lie on the Gergonne line. The circles with centers X',Y',Z' passing respectively through X,Y,Z are orthogonal to the incircle and to the Gergonne line, forming a coaxal system with the Gergonne line as line of centers. The radical axis is the Soddy line, which passes through X(1) and X(7) and is the line of centers of the orthogonal coaxal system, which includes the Soddy circles. Among the points on this line are the two limiting points (point-circles of the system): X(3638) and X(3639). The former lies between X(7) and the inner Soddy point, X(175).

Coordinates and properties for the points P=X(3638) and Q=X(3639) were found by Peter Moses (September 3, 2011):<br>
midpoint(P,Q) = X(1323)<br>
crossdifference(P,Q) = X(657)<br>
crosssum(P,Q) = X(36)<br>
cevapoint(P,Q) = X(80)<br>
idealpoint(P,Q) = X(516)<br>
Q = {X(1),X(7)}-harmonic conjugate of P<br>
Q = inverse-in-incircle of P</p>
<p>Write I = X(1), U = X(7), r = inradius, R = circumradius, and d =
4*sqrt(3)*area(ABC). Then distance ratios are given by |IP|/|PU| = 2r(r
+ 4R)/d and |IQ|/|QU| = -2r(r + 4R)/d</p>
<p>X(3638) lies on these lines: 1,7&nbsp;&nbsp; 14,226&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
X(3638) = X(15)-of-intouch-triangle<br>
X(3638) = isogonal conjugate of X(36737)<br>
X(3638) = crossdifference of every pair of points on line X(657)X(7127)<br>
