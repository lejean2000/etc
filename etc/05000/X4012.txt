Let DEF be the extouch triangle of ABC.  Let Ha be the hyperbola with foci E and F, passing through A, and define Hb and Hc cyclically.  These three hyperbolas have two common points, U and V.  Let Pa be the pole of the line UV with respect to Ha, and define Pb and Pc cyclically.  Then DEF and PaPBPc are perspective at X(4012).  (Angel Montesdeoca, September 23, 2018)
