<p>
As a point on the Euler line, X(3548) has Shinagawa coefficients (E - 4F, -E).
</p>
<p>
Let La be the polar of X(4) wrt the circle centered at A and passing through X(3), and define Lb and Lc cyclically.  (Note that X(4) is the perspector of any circle centered at a vertex of ABC.)  Let A" = Lb&cap;Lc, and define B" and C" cyclically.  Triangle A"B"C" is homothetic to the medial triangle, and the center of homothety is X(3548).  (Randy Hutson, December 11, 2015)
