X(4577) is the center of the conic that passes through the following six points:  the vertices of the antipedal triangle of X(3) and the vertices of the antipedal triangle of X(4).  Other points on this conic are X(i) for these i:  2, 6, 22, 5596, 8264, 8266, 8267, 8272.  See the preamble to X(8268). Note added: this conic is the bianticevian conic of X(2) and X(6).
