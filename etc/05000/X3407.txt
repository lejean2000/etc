Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle.  X(3407) is the radical center of the circumcircles of A'BC, B'CA, C'AB.  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle and A"B"C" be the 1st anti-Brocard triangle.           Let A* be the diagonal crosspoint of trapezoid B'C'C"B" (i.e., the intersection of lines B'C" and C'B"); define B* and C* cyclically.  The lines AA*, BB*, CC* concur in X(3407).

X(3407) and related points occupy Bernard Gibert's Table 38. See the
note at X(3364).</p>

<p>X(3407) lies on the Kiepert hyperbola and these lines:
1,1501&nbsp;&nbsp; 6,1916&nbsp;&nbsp; 76,384&nbsp;&nbsp;
321,2205&nbsp;&nbsp; 983,985</p>

<p>X(3407) = isogonal conjugate of X(3094)<br>
X(3407) = isotomic conjugate of X(3314)<br>
X(3407) = cevapoint of X(32) and X(182)</p>
