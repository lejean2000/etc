Let A'B'C' be the 1st Brocard triangle.  Let Oa be the circumcenter of A'BC, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The lines AOa, BOb, COc concur in X(3399).  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

Let A' be the apex of the isosceles triangle BA'C constructed inward on BC such that &ang;A'BC = &ang;A'CB = &omega;.  Define B' and C' cyclically.  Let Oa be the circumcenter of BA'C, and define Ob and Oc cyclically.  The lines AOa, BOb, COc concur in X(3399).  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)
