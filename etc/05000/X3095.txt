Let U be the pedal triangle of the 1st Brocard point of ABC, and let V be the pedal triangle of the 2nd Brocard point.  Let X' = X(39)-of-U and Y' = X(512)-of-U; let X'' = X(39)-of-V and Y'' = X(512)-of-V.  Then X(3095) = X'Y'&cap;X''Y''.  (Randy Hutson, September 5 , 2015)

Let X be a point on the 2nd Brocard circle.  The locus of X(4) of triangle XPU(1) as X varies is a circle with center X(3095).  This circle is the reflection of the 2nd Brocard circle in X(39).  See also X(9821).  (Randy Hutson, July 20, 2016)

The locus of the orthocenter in a Brocard porism (triangles sharing circumcircle and Brocard inellipse with ABC) is a circle with center X(3095) and segment X(3557)X(3558) as diameter.  The circle also passes through X(4) and its antipode X(194). (Randy Hutson, August 29, 2018)

Let O<sub>A</sub> be the circle centered at the A-vertex of the 5th anti-Brocard triangle and passing through A; define O<sub>B</sub> and O<sub>C</sub> cyclically.  X(3095) is the radical center of O<sub>A</sub>, O<sub>B</sub>, O<sub>C</sub>.  (Randy Hutson, August 28, 2020)
