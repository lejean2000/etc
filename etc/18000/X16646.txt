In a triangle ABC, build equilateral triangles BCA&prime;, CAB&prime;, ABC&prime; inwards ABC. The triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is named the <b>inner-Fermat</b>  triangle of ABC. Similarly, if BCA&Prime;, CAB&Prime;, ABC&Prime; are equilateral triangles built outwards ABC, the triangle A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is the <b>outer-Fermat</b> triangle of ABC.
</p>
<p>
Both triangles are perspective with perspector X(3) to the following triangles: (anti-Hutson intouch, anti-incircle-circles, 6th anti-mixtilinear, Ara, Ascella, 1st Brocard, 1st circumperp, 2nd circumperp, 1st Ehrmann, 2nd Euler, Fuhrmann, 2nd Fuhrmann, Johnson, Kosnita, McCay, medial, inner-Napoleon, outer-Napoleon, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, tangential, Trinh, inner-Vecten and outer-Vecten. The perspector of the inner- and outer-Fermat triangles is also X(3).
</p>
<p>The inner-Fermat triangle is also perspective to the following triangles with given perspectors: (ABC, X(14)), (anti-Artzt, X(16646)), (1st anti-Brocard, X(16648)), (anti-McCay, X(16650)), (anticomplementary, X(616)), (Artzt, X(16652)), (excentral, X(1277)), (reflection, X(15)). The outer-Fermat triangle is also perspective to the following triangles with given perspectors:
(ABC, X(13)), (anti-Artzt, X(16647)), (1st anti-Brocard, X(16649)), (anti-McCay, X(16651)), (anticomplementary, X(617)), (Artzt, X(16653)), (excentral, X(1276)), (reflection, X(16)).  <br>
