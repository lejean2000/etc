Let ABC be a triangle and let A<sub>1</sub> be the midpoint of the arc BC of its circumcircle not containing A. Define B&prime; and C&prime; cyclically. The triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is called the <b>Fuhrmann triangle of ABC</b>. (See Fuhrmann triangle from <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FuhrmannTriangle.html">MathWorld</a>). The Furhrman triangle is the reflection of the 2nd circumperp triangle in the sidelines of ABC.

Let ABC be a triangle and let A&Prime; be the midpoint of the arc BC containing A, and define B&Prime; and C&Prime; cyclically.. The triangle A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is here named the <b>2nd Fuhrmann triangle of ABC</b>. This triangle is the reflection of the 1st circumperp triangle in the sidelines of ABC. Its A-vertex has barycentric coordinates:
<br>
<br>&emsp;A&Prime; = -a^2 : b*c+a^2-c^2 : b*c+a^2-b^2
</p>
<p>
A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; has area S*(2*r+3*R)/(4*r), where r, R and S are the inradius, circumradius and double-area of ABC, respectively.
</p>
<p>
The 2nd Fuhrmann triangle is perspective to triangles in the following list with perspector X(3): anti-Hutson intouch, anti-incircle-circles, 6th anti-mixtilinear, Ara, Ascella, 1st Brocard, 1st circumperp, 2nd circumperp, 1st Ehrmann, 2nd Euler, Fuhrmann, Johnson, inner-Johnson, outer-Johnson, Kosnita, McCay, medial, inner-Napoleon, outer-Napoleon, 1st Neuberg, 2nd Neuberg, tangential, Trinh, inner-Vecten, outer-Vecten. Also, A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; is perspective to the inner- and outer-Johnson triangles with perspectors X(16112) and X(12635), respectively.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T, i, j) in the following list means that triangles A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; and T are orthologic with centers X(i) and X(j):
<br>
(ABC, 3, 79), (ABC-X3 reflections, 3, 16113), (anti-Aquila, 3, 3649), (anti-Ara, 3, 16114), (5th anti-Brocard, 3, 16115), (anti-Euler, 3, 16116), (anti-Mandart-incircle, 3, 16117), (anticomplementary, 3, 3648), (Aquila, 3, 16118), (Ara, 3, 16119), (Ascella, 4, 6675), (Atik, 4, 16120), (1st Auriga, 3, 16121), (2nd Auriga, 3, 16122), (5th Brocard, 3, 16123), (2nd circumperp tangential, 3, 13743), (1st circumperp, 4, 3651), (2nd circumperp, 4, 21), (inner-Conway, 4, 11684), (Conway, 4, 21), (2nd Conway, 4, 14450), (3rd Conway, 4, 16124), (Euler, 3, 16125), (3rd Euler, 4, 6841), (4th Euler, 4, 442), (excenters-midpoints, 12635, 442), (excenters-reflections, 4, 16126), (excentral, 4, 191), (extouch, 16127, 3650), (2nd extouch, 4, 442), (Feuerbach, 5, 442), (Fuhrmann, 6326, 191), (inner-Garcia, 16128, 3648), (outer-Garcia, 3, 11684), (Garcia-reflection, 12635, 21), (Gossard, 3, 16129), (inner-Grebe, 3, 16130), (outer-Grebe, 3, 16131), (hexyl, 4, 16132), (Honsberger, 4, 16133), (Hutson extouch, 16134, 442), (inner-Hutson, 4, 16135), (Hutson intouch, 4, 10543), (outer-Hutson, 4, 16136), (incircle-circles, 4, 16137), (intouch, 4, 3649), (inverse-in-incircle, 4, 10122), (Johnson, 3, 3652), (inner-Johnson, 3, 16138), (outer-Johnson, 3, 16139), (1st Johnson-Yff, 3, 16140), (2nd Johnson-Yff, 3, 16141), (Lucas homothetic, 3, 16161), (Lucas(-1) homothetic, 3, 16162), (Mandart-incircle, 3, 16142), (medial, 3, 3647), (5th mixtilinear, 3, 5441), (6th mixtilinear, 4, 16143), (2nd Pamfilos-Zhou, 4, 16144), (1st Schiffler, 16145, 10266), (2nd Schiffler, 12635, 11604), (1st Sharygin, 4, 21), (tangential-midarc, 4, 16146), (2nd tangential-midarc, 4, 16147), (3rd tri-squares-central, 3, 16148), (4th tri-squares-central, 3, 16149), (X3-ABC reflections, 3, 16150), (Yff central, 4, 16151), (inner-Yff, 3, 16152), (outer-Yff, 3, 16153), (inner-Yff tangents, 3, 16154), (outer-Yff tangents, 3, 16155)
</p>
<p>
Note: if T* is a triangle homothetic to ABC, then T* and the 2nd Fuhrmann triangles are orthologic with centers X(3)-of-ABC and X(79)-of-T*.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T, i, j) in the following list means that triangles A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; and T are parallelogic with centers X(i) and X(j): (1st Parry, 3, 16156), (2nd Parry, 3, 16157), (2nd Sharygin, 4, 16158)
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T, i, j) in the following list means that triangles A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; and T are cyclologic with centers X(i) and X(j): (ABC, 4, 5127), (excentral, 399, 6326), (Fuhrmann, 3448, 4).
</p>
<p>
In the following list, (i, j) means that X(i)-of-A&Prime;B&Prime;C&Prime; = X(j): (2, 1699), (3, 16159), (4, 7701), (5, 16160)
