Let F = X(13) be the 1st Fermat point of ABC. Let A<sub>b</sub> and A<sub>c</sub> be the points where the circle FBC cuts again AC and AB, respectively. Define B<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>a</sub> and C<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>b</sub> cyclically. Let A&prime;, B&prime;, C&prime; be centroids of AB<sub>c</sub>C<sub>b</sub>, BC<sub>a</sub>A<sub>c</sub>, CA<sub>b</sub>B<sub>a</sub> respectively. Then the triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is equilateral and will be named here the <b>13th Fermat-Dao equilateral triangle</b>. (Dao Thanh Oai, March 19, 2018)
</p>
<p>
When F=X(14), i.e., the 2nd Fermat point of ABC, the resulting triangle is also equilateral and will be named here the <b>14th Dao-Fermat equilateral triangle</b>.
</p>
<p>The perspector of the 13th and 14th Fermat-Dao triangles is X(6) and both are perspective with the same perspector to these triangles: ABC, anti-Conway, 2nd anti-Conway, 2nd Brocard, circumsymmedial, 2nd Ehrmann, inner-Grebe, outer-Grebe, 1st Kenmotu diagonals, 2nd Kenmotu diagonals, 2nd orthosymmedial, symmedial, tangential, inner tri-equilateral, outer tri-equilateral.
</p>
<p>
The 13th Fermat-Dao is also perspective to these triangles: 1st Fermat-Dao* at X(16636), 5th Fermat-Dao* at X(8014), outer-Le Viet An* at X(3130), 9th Fermat-Dao* at X(6) and 10th Fermat-Dao** at X(6).
</p>
<p>
The 14th Fermat-Dao is also perspective to these triangles: 2nd Fermat-Dao* at X(16637), 6th Fermat-Dao* at X(8015), inner-Le Viet An* at X(3129), 9th Fermat-Dao** at X(6) and 10th Fermat-Dao* at X(6).
</p>
<p>Note: an asterisk * means that the triangles are homothetic, and ** means that they are inversely similar.
