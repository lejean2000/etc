Let F = X(13) be the 1st Fermat point of ABC. Let A<sub>b</sub> and A<sub>c</sub> be the points where the circle FBC cuts again AC and AB, respectively. Define B<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>a</sub> and C<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>b</sub> cyclically.  Denote A&prime;, B&prime;, C&prime; the circumcenters of AB<sub>c</sub>C<sub>b</sub>, BC<sub>a</sub>A<sub>c</sub> and CB<sub>a</sub>A<sub>b</sub>, respectively. Then the triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is equilateral and is here named the <b>11th Dao-Fermat equilateral triangle</b>. (Dao Thanh Oai, March 19, 2018)
</p>
<p>
When F=X(14), i.e., the 2nd Fermat point of ABC, the resulting triangle is also equilateral and is here named the <b>12th Dao-Fermat equilateral triangle</b>.
</p>
<p>
Both 11th and 12th Fermat-Dao equilateral triangles have center X(381), which also is their center of inverse similitude.
</p>
<p>
The appearance of (T,n) in the following list means that T and the 11th Dao-equilateral triangle are perspective with perspector X(n); in this list and the next, an asterisk * means that the triangles are homothetic, and ** means that they are inversely similar.
