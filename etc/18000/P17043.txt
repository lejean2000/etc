If A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is a central triangle other than ABC and P and U are triangle centers, then (A,B,C,P; A&prime;,B&prime;,C&prime;,U) is a regular collineation, as is its inverse, given by (A&prime;,B&prime;,C&prime;,U; A,B,C,P).
</p>
<p>
The collineation images at X(17043)-X(17097) result from A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; = medial triangle, P = X(2), and U = X(1).  We write the image of X as m(X); let m<sup>-1</sup> denote the inverse collineation.  Then centers X(17043)-X(17073) are examples of m(X), and X(17074)-X(17097) are examples of m<sup>-1</sup>(X). Other examples are given by the following list, in which the appearance of (i,j) means that m(X(i)) = X(j):
</p>
<p>
(1,142), (2,1), (3,16608), (4, 17073), (5, 17043), (6,2886), (7,2), (8,4000), (9,11019), (10,3946), (37,3742), (56,141), (57,10), (85,37), (651,11)
</p>
<p>
A collineation maps lines to lines.  The appearance of {h,i} &srarr; {j,k} in the next list means that m(X(h)X(i)) = X(j)X(k):
</p>
<p>
{1,2} &srarr; {1,142}<br>
{1,3} &srarr; {10,141}<br>
{2,3} &srarr; {1,16608}<br>
{2,7} &srarr; {1,2}<br>
{2,85} &srarr; {1,6}<br>
{2,222} &srarr; {1,5}<br>
{7,8} &srarr; {2,37}<br>
{7,27} &srarr; {2,3}<br>
</p>
<p>
A regular collineation m is a permutation of the set S of triangle centers.  That is, m maps S onto S, and if U and V are in S and m(U) = m(V), then U = V.  As an illustration, the appearance of (i,j,k) in the following list means that
</p>
<p>
X(17102) = (A,B,C,X(i); A&prime;,B&prime;,C&prime;,X(j)) collineation image of X(k),  where A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; = medial triangle.
</p>
<p>
In particular, for every i and j, such a k is uniquely determined.  (List contributed by Peter Moses, April 6, 2018)
