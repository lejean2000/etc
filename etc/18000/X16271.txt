<b> Theorem 1.  The points A, B, C, X(357), X(1136), X(1134) lie on a conic.</b>  (Dao Thanh Oai, March 1, 2018)
</p>
<p>
The conic is here named the Morley conic.
</p>
<p>
<b> Theorem 2.  Let P be a point on the Morley conic.  There exists a family of equilateral triangles UVW, all homothetic to the 1st Morley equilateral triangle, with U on PA, V on PB, and W on PC.</b>  (Dao Thanh Oai, March 1, 2018)

<p>
A trilinear equation for the Morley conic is
</p>
<p>
sin(B/3 - C/3) y z + sin(C/3 - A/3) z x + sin(A/3 - B/3)x y = 0.
</p>
<p>
The conic passes through X(i) for i  = 14, 357, 1134, 1136, 3602, 3603, 3604, 13593, and has perspector X(5637).  The isogonal conjugate of the conic is the tripolar of X(14146), which passes through the perspectors of ABC and the 1st Morley adjunct triangle, the 2nd Morley adjunct triangle, and the 3rd Morley adjunct triangle.

X(16271) lies on no line X(i)X(j) for 1 &le; i &lt; j &le; 16272. <br>
</p>
<p>
X(16271) = X(2)-Ceva conjugate of X(5637)<br>
