Let F = X(13) be the 1st Fermat point. Let B<sub>a</sub>, B<sub>c</sub> be the points on BC such that FB<sub>a</sub>C<sub>a</sub> is an equilateral triangle. Define C<sub>b</sub>, A<sub>b</sub> and A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub> cyclically.  Let A&prime;, B&prime;, C&prime; be the midpoints of A<sub>b</sub>A<sub>c</sub>, B<sub>c</sub>B<sub>a</sub>, C<sub>a</sub>C<sub>b</sub>, respectively. Then the triangle A&prime;B&prime;C&prime; is equilateral and is here named the <b>9th Dao-Fermat equilateral triangle</b>. (Dao Thanh Oai, March 15, 2018)
</p>
<p>
When F=X(14)=the 2nd Fermat point of ABC, the resulting triangle is also equilateral and is here named the <b>10th Dao-Fermat equilateral triangle</b>.
</p>
<p>
The centers of the 9th and 10th Fermat-Dao equilateral triangles are X(11624) and X(11626), respectively and their sides are congruent. Both triangles are perspective with perspector X(6) to these triangles: ABC, anti-Conway, 2nd anti-Conway, 2nd Brocard, circumsymmedial, 2nd Ehrmann, inner-Grebe, outer-Grebe, 1st Kenmotu diagonals, 2nd Kenmotu diagonals, 2nd orthosymmedial, symmedial, tangential, inner tri-equilateral and outer tri-equilateral. Also, the 9th triangle is homothetic to the outer-Le Viet An triangle with center X(11142) and perspective to the medial and orthic triangles with perspectors X(16534) and X(16536), respectively. Finally, the 10th triangle is homothetic to the inner-Le Viet An triangle with center X(11141) and perspective to the medial and orthic triangles with perspectors X(16535) and X(16537), respectively.
